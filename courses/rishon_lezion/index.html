<h2>The Rishon Martial arts dojo</h2>
The AKBAN martial arts academy was founded in <a href="http://www.akban.org/courses/jerusalem/">Jerusalem</a> by Yossi Sheriff at
1986. Assaf Hochman is Yossi's student from the very beginning, Assaf founded the AKBAN academy in Rishon Lezion for traditional MMA and traditional rock climbing in 2010 after 12 years of martial arts and rock climbing instruction at the city of Modiin.
Our academy is based on learning and improving our martial arts knowledge hand in hand with preserving tradition. Our urban warrior way of life makes it a necessity to educate our students in outdoor training such as rock climbing. A group of veterans practice every week. Both veterans and beginners of all ages can enjoy the warm and non-competitive atmosphere during and after practice.
