Attack surface is not necessarily spatial, though it can be.
</p><p>An attack vector is a technique, way, or area through which an attacking entity can harm a defender. The purpose of the defense is to reduce the attack surface, predict the possible attack vectors and perform randomization and preparation of the defense vectors.
</p><p>Systemic complexity of the defence increases the attack surface.
</p><p>Attack surfaces of individuals, groups of individuals and societies may present similar vectors. Despite this, the attack surface is not fractal but complex, with each attack vector adding complexity.
</p><p>Each attack vector can be isolated and in conjunction with some of the attack vectors it is possible, in a systematic way, to build defense vectors with the help of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/">methodical pyramids</a> built ‘top down’ from relevant <a href="/wiki/Tatakai" class="mw-redirect" title="Tatakai">tatakai</a> scenarios.
</p><p>Analysis of the attack surface by isolating attack vectors must be done when the overall view and comprehension of the attack surface is clear. Focusing on certain vectors and lack of perspective of the entire attack surface exposes the individual and the accumulated individuals.
</p><p>War is an attack vector that combines various means that meticulously constitute vectors in their own right.
