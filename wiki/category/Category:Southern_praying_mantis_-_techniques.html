<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Almost all techniques, forms and fighting “scenarios” are based on the assumption that an opponent is set to hurt the practitioner and not vice versa; Techniques where the practitioner himself initiates an attack himself are a development of later decades. Hence, there is a vast use of “traps” aimed at luring the opponent into delivering a blow, thus reducing the need for “closing the distance”. Accordingly, most techniques are counter-attacks aimed to “absorb” the first blow and react.
There are almost no forms practicing joint locks: all contact with the opponent’s limbs is usually used as a “bridge” for hitting the loins, upper body or head, the head being the main target for most blows. Any locks aren’t made on joints but rather get the opponent’s limbs tangled for better striking positions.
A unique form of “Sticky Limbs”, or “Chi Sao”, aimed to help the practitioner gain close range sensitivity for the opponent’s actions without seeing them, and for control over their movement, relevant mostly to very close distances.
Fast connecting blows (using circular movements and a “high-low” concept) intended to knock a close opponent unconscious in a short time without reacting to changes in range or timing (assuming that the practitioner sets the timing and the range remains close)
Almost no drills include reference to footwork. Most moves are short ranged steps, used to protect the loins and lower body and to deliver low kicks while closing the distance.
