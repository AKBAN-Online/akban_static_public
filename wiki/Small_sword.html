<div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr" class="mw-content-ltr"><div class="mw-parser-output"><p>The <b>small sword</b> or <b>smallsword</b> (also <b>court sword</b>, fr: <i>L'épée de cour</i> or <b>dress sword</b>) is a light one-handed <a href="/wiki/Sword" title="Sword">sword</a> designed for thrusting.
</p><p>As a rule, the blade of a smallsword is comparatively short (about 60-80 centimeters). It usually tapers to a sharp point but may lack a cutting edge. It is typically triangular in cross-section, although some of the early examples still have the rhombic and [[spindle (textile)|spindle-shaped cross-sections inherited from older weapons, like the rapier. This triangular cross-section may be hollow ground for additional lightness and stiffness. Many small swords of the period between the 17th and 18th centuries were found with colichemarde blades.
</p><p>The guard is small (typically 3-5 inches in diameter), approximately flat and either round or composed of two oval lobes ("figure of eight"). There is usually a knuckle-bow and either one or two short quillons, used to strengthen the wielder's grip and provide increased points of control.
