During his life he taught in various European countries, most notably in Denmark where he was the fencing instructor of King Christian IV. It was during his time in Copenhagen that he published his treatise on rapier fencing,
</p><p><i><b>Lo Schermo, overo Scienza dâ€™Arme</b></i>, in 1606. The treatise became a fencing bestseller around Europe.
</p><p>In his treatise, Fabris deals with sword alone, sword and knife, sword and cape as well as bare-handed fighting against a man armed with a dagger. Also, he is unique in the fact that he includes a whole "Book II" for advanced techniques. His writing style is concise and effective, even by modern standards, and he shows a loving respect for the reader and for all who may study his system.
