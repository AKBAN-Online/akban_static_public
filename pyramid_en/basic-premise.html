<b><h2>Combat or competition</h2></b>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Methodical Pyramid is a helpful model. It describes the process and progress in the learning of movement. It was developed for martial-art, but morphed into a more comprehensive model that can facilitates other goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This does not stand as a contradiction to other models that use analysis as means of navigation and categorization. There are models that analyze martial-arts along other parameters such as types of techniques, "softness", country of origin etc. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pyramid working methodology is based on the following premise: <strong>a martial-art prepares its practitioners for real fighting as well.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are well-aware of other aspects enhanced by martial-arts, and abide by them: humaneness, physical health, aesthetics and precise movement, and other realms that make training in martial arts so rewarding.</p>


<b><h3 style="text-align: justify;">The need for new terminology</h3></b>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As work on the model began, I used Japanese terms to describe the different levels. In time, as more general applications were developed for the pyramid progress model, the use of descriptive English/Hebrew terms seemed more intuitive. The tradition is, indeed, Japanese, but it needs to be adjusted for clarity. The precise meaning of terms is important: the existence of different interpretations for the same term hinders learning and sharing knowledge among various disciplines. Some contents that receive a precise definition in this booklet are different from those commonly used in our field. As more professionals use the names and terminology of this model we will facilitate communication and development among peers.</p>
