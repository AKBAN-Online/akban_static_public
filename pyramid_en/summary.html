The detailed progress model helps locate problems, isolate them and focus on their solution. One of the main problems, unnecessary injuries, can be located at every progress level. Recognizing causes of injury is the first step to diminishing injuries to opponents and self as a result of body misuse.

The model aims to develop not only progress but also communication amongst martial-artists. Agreement is not a prerequisite - the progress model is open to criticism, but mutual understanding is needed in order to avoid mistakes made by others in the past. If one realizes the inevitable necessity of proper physical preparation, then it is no longer important whether preparation is geared for Budo Ninjutsu or for a competitive Judo fight. Understanding the benefit of Kata practice, it no longer matters whether these are individually-executed or partner-synchronized. And most importantly, if the difference between sparring and real- fighting is understood, training addresses violent reality but without bringing its ugly face into the dojo - where the method is practiced.
