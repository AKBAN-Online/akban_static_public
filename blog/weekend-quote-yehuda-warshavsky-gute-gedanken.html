The work went with a strict and thorough procedure that prevented accidents when, in the tiny and dark workshop, five blacksmiths were squeezed working on three anvils for 12 hours a day. 

An interesting ceremony, that repeated even in other workshops in Germany I visited, was the ceremony of quenching the steel. 

Every blacksmith was busy doing his work, and when he reached the time to quench the heated steel in oil the Maister himself would knock on the anvil and everybody, in unison, loudly proclaimed: "Good thoughts" (Gute Gedanken).
