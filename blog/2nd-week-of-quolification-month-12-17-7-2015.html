This Friday, 17.7.2015, we will have basic preparation for randori session at 08:00 sharp. 
There will not be a Sunday evening session in Tel Aviv dojo. The Jerusalem Sunday session takes place at Tedi as usual. 

The last several weeks has seen deepening of our technical skills in close range skirmish and also higher level of fitness. We will add two more Uchikomi to our throws drill and also add one more kick to our partner drills. 
Please do not forget boxing gloves and, for those who need it, also boxing bandages. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp9fN73Ec58">link to a video tutorial</a> on it.
