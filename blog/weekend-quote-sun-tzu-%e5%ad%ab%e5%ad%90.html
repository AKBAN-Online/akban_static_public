All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; 
when using our forces, we must seem inactive; 
when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. 
If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. 
If he is in superior strength, evade him. 
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. 
Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. 
If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. 
If his forces are united, separate them. 
Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
  
兵者，詭道也。故能而示之不能，用而示之不用，近而示之遠，遠而示之近。利而誘之，亂而取之，實而備之，強而避之，怒而撓之，卑而驕之，佚而勞之，親而離之。攻其無備，出其不意，此兵家之勝，不可先傳也。
