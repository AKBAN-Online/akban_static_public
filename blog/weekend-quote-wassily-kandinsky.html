Thus, the form may seem pleasant, unpleasant, beautiful, harmonious, disharmonious, skillful, awkward, fine, coarse, and so on, and yet, it must neither be accepted nor rejected by virtue of qualities considered to be positive or negative. All these concepts are perfectly relative, which can be observed at first glance in the infinite series of interchange of forms already present.

Equally relative is the form itself. Thus, the form is to be appreciated and understood. One has to place oneself in such a way that the form acts on the soul. And through the form the content (mind, inner sound). 

Otherwise, one elevates the relative to the absolute.
