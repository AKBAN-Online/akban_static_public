<a href="http://www.mrdankelly.com/martialads.html"> In this great gallery</a> you can catch up with our childhood fantasies. Ads promising everything from joining the black Ninja society to learning the secret devastating fatal techniques of the Dim Mak expert are offered at a price starting from 99 cents.

It's a pity we lost so many years training, when we could have paid the money and get over with it.

Well...
In the words of one disappointed student: "what? What do you mean 12 years for a black belt? don't you have something faster?"
There you go, just 99 cent plus delivery.
