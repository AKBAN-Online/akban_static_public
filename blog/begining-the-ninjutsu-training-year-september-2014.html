This week we are starting a new training year (2014-2015). This is the 28th year of training since I got <a title="doron navon" href="http://www.akban.org/doron-navon-the-first-foreign-bujinkan-shihan">Doron Navon</a>'s blessing to teach Ninjutsu.
After analysing the videos I take during sessions and the performances during <a title="belt exams" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Category:Belts_-_Grade_requirements_-_Ninjutsu">Grade exams</a>, I thought that emphasizing several lines of work would be appropriate.

These are next year's lines of work.
<ol>
	<li>The Friday weapon session will diversify. We are continuing the sword and emotional modulation and will explore Short stick (Jogo De Pau). All AKBAN students are invited.</li>
	<li>Even though the general fitness in the <a title="grade exams" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Category:Belts_-_Grade_requirements_-_Ninjutsu">grade exams</a> was higher then ever, we will have some very robust session.</li>
	<li>Advanced practitioners in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv dojo will learn more Kata from the higher levels of the <a title="ninjutsu portal" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Portal:_Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</a> Ryu. Another line of work will be <a title="family defense and security" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Family_defense_and_Security">Family defense and security</a>. We will deal with improvised weapons, multiple opponents scenarios and advanced sabaki.</li>
	<li>I will video and work the beginning of lesson drills. We will perform impact drill each lesson (punching mitts, bag work or pad work).</li>
	<li>More seminars, <a title="colloquium" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Category:Colloquiums_in_AKBAN">Colloquium</a>, outside sessions, "24" , And Desert gathering.</li>
	<li>Focus on dynamic work for Tatakai</li>
	<li> Outside teachers' seminars: Meditation, Jogo de Pau.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Using the name AKBAN</h4>
Our school does not work like a fast food franchise, it works like Universities do.
Every instructor enjoys full independence while teaching the techniques that lead to a Black belt. This independence comes with full responsibility of each instructor over his own dojo. Thus, each instructor can bring into fruition a personal perspective and abilities and contribute his knowledge to the technical data base that forms the AKBAN database.
Choosing whether to give the name AKBAN is a personal creed of the head of each dojo who is also a student in central dojo under Yossi Sheriff.
The instructor leads his dojo, but chooses to continue and develop as a part of a community that follows the ethical code of AKBAN.
