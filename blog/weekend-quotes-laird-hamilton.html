Fearlessness is ignorance, and it's lack of respect - If you're not scared then you don't have <a href="http://www.akban.org/2012/01/12/respect" title="respect">respect</a>. There's no way on earth you can go out and look at waves of that magnitude and not respect it enough to fear it. 

This whole "no fear" concept - in a way there is no such thing. If you don't have fear than it's just a matter of time. 

My favorite old saying is, "There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots."
