When you walk alone, you must lower risks. "Play it safe. Choose a simpler route. learn the topography better. Carry more water. Lower luxury items and again, be prepared: know your map."

You can not walk alone if you did not prepare your body and your mind set. You, you-yourself, is the most important piece of equipment you must prepare. Focus on preparing yourself. If you do not understand the details, do not go out alone, because, like randori, you will get hit if you lied to yourself. 

Alone: do not sleep on the road or near the road, do not make noise, do not light a fire where you intend to sleep. If you are alone and you are looking for a place to sleep, look for a good place during the afternoon, remember its location, pass it. Then, if you want to light a fire, do so, cook, eat, drink tea. At dusk, pack your things and return quietly to where you you previously decided. 

When you are alone, fear must pay you a visit. It might be daytime, it might be middle of the night, but it will visit. When fear comes to visit, be a good host, then let it depart on it's way.
