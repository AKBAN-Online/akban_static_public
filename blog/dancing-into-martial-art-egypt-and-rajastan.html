<p><span style="font-size: inherit;">Sometimes we rejoice in a little mystery. Instead of trying to reveal it all one can embrace the intangible. It is happier this way, more exciting.</span></p>
<p>When I was young, years ago, we played a bad game. My kindergaten teacher gave a kid a wrapped box. Then one kid would open the outer wraps, pass it on to another kid and at the end the so called "winner" would be left with some stupid eraser. Why open it? The box can sit, unopened, till the very end </p>
<p>Insights about martial arts can be this wrapped secret, this is why I love <a title="kukishin ryu techniques" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Techniques_-_Kukishinden_Ryu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ninjutsu Kata</a>.</p>
<p>To is it should all be revealed as quickly as possible. This lack of patience is the mark of very disturbed kids. Everything should be understood immediately. <span style="font-size: inherit;"> </span></p>
<p>Maybe just a little bit, a hint. When I look at the video my Yoga teacher, <a title="nir adin" href="https://www.facebook.com/nir.adin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nir Adin</a>, posted I see the <a title="yoko aruki" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Yoko_Aruki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoko Aruki step</a>, I see work against several opponents, but even more - I see harmony. As we, martial arts practitioners sometimes guess, not all humans come to attack us, the majority just want to interact.</p>
<p>These insights, these experiences, are embedded inside many folk dances, from <a title="tahtib" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Tahtib" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Egyptian Tahtib</a> to the dance done during the Holi festival in Rajastan. Here is the mesmerizing thing.</p>
