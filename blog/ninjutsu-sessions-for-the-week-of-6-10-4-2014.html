Training this week, the week before the Passover holiday, will take place as usual and will evolve around speed, rhythm and tempo for winning combats. As we saw in the previous week, a fighter can not use tempo deception without integrating it into his game-play. As my teacher, <a href="http://www.akban.org/doron-navon-the-first-foreign-bujinkan-shihan" title="doron navon">Doron Navon</a> sensei told me: "Sheriff, learn to dance!". 

Using sequences 2 and 3 we will continue to explore rhythm changes in <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Category:Techniques_-_Kukishinden_Ryu" title="kukishinden ryu kaya">Kukishinden Ryu kata</a> <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Syncopation" title="syncopation">Syncopation</a> and in <a href="http://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/randori-sparring.php" title="randori">randori</a>. Only after working with movement and line of sight deception through Gyokko Ryu's <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Ku_no_kata,_Gyokko_Ry%C5%AB_-_Ninjutsu" title="ku no kata">Ku no Kata</a> we can move and explore speed and rhythm. Using Rami L. technology we will advance from resting speeds into faster, aerobic pace.  

Several terms are important to better understand deception in combat. Whoever employs deception in conflict and succeeds, rules the conflict. A combat situation that involves only power and speed is missing a crucial element. The speed, rhythm and tempo of the sequences are an advanced deception. Using the <a href="http://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/" title="methodical pyramid">Methodical pyramid</a> we analyse battles, conflicts and sport matches and observe the different rhythm and tempo requirements of different disciplines. 

In the two videos attached we can observe examples from two different disciplines that use rhythm and tempo. Roy Jones Junior is a superb boxer that first and foremost controls the basic building blocks of a fighter: he is fit, he packs immensely strong punches and, most important, he controls distance with an amazing footwork and <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Tai_sabaki_-_Movement_and_evasion" title="sabaki">sabaki</a>. The thing that distinguishes Jones in this collection of Knockouts, is his use of tempo and rhythm changes for deception. To the untrained eye it might be easier to see this when he uses, again and again, a slow circular windmill movement deception that always surprises because of the changed tempo. 

The second video is of <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB_(%E5%A4%A9%E7%9C%9F%E6%AD%A3%E4%BC%9D%E9%A6%99%E5%8F%96%E7%A5%9E%E9%81%93%E6%B5%81)" title="tsksr">TSKSR</a> kata. In the Katori <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Kata" title="kata">kata</a> many sequences, each one of them finishes the fight, are crammed together into a continues short kata. This one is good learning material because we get to see and hear both the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Syncopation" title="syncopation">syncopation</a> that ends each sub sequence and the Katori <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Kiai,_use_of_voice_in_martial_arts" title="kiai">kiai</a> that denotes these syncopation. 

Let me remind that is part of my effort to prepare the knowledge background for the 3rd colloquium that will take place after the Passover Holiday, at Friday, April the 25th. 08:00 sharp. Here's a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1403289789939321" title="3rd colloquium">link to the 3rd colloquium event on Facebook</a>. 

<h3>Training seminar in Passover</h3>
