"But how do I relate to all the Hodge-podge written here", asks the average Ninja, and that's exactly what I like. The Israeli Ninja is a Sabra through and through, he is not a person of subtle hints and intricacies, a no-bulshit man. But he doesn't stop thinking, doesn't take anything for granted, he want's you to either do something for real or shut up, so at this stage, I'll just shut up.
