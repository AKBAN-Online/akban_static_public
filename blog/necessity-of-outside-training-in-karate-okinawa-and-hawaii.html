A refreshing article describes training outside in <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Karate"> Karate</a> as a necessary part of the student's regime.   
The writer of the article, who practices old school Chibana Chosin Shorin Ryu and Ryukyu Kobudo, writes about old school karate groups that used to go out in Okinawa and practice in the dark of night. 
I enjoyed reading about other martial arts and schools that like us, in <a href="http://www.akban.org/about/index.php"> Akban</a>, use the benefits and the real advantage of training outside. 

There is absolutely no substitute to outside training, a person who learned stepping only inside a dojo will be missing an important aspect of combat and will also have many other deficits that will inhibit his growth in martial arts. This is  especially important in these modern times when everything that surrounds us is urban and man made.
