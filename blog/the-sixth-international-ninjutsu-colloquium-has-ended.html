The recent Colloquium started diving into the different ways the Ryu in Takamatsu-den deal with resistance. To explore the subject we will need a whole year. 
Honored us with their presence and teaching skills, Itai Guvrin, Yossi Teshuva, Dr. Gadi Lissak, Tomer Hollander and more top levels from Bujinkan in Israel then we could count. Amir Haimi from "Jerusalem Martial arts" shared many perspectives on throws and fighting. 
Till the full hour long video will be ready with the English translation here's a short promo with the music by our Berlin dojo Cho, Ran Levari. 
See you at the Autumn Colloquium.
