When you are alone and looking for a place to sleep: When you pass a suitable place at the afternoon, remember it, continue walking, stop somewhere, eat and make some tea and then, at twilight, quitly go back to it. If you want to make fire, do it, cook, make some tea and then, when it's dark, pack up and move to the place you picked before, even if it's 100 meters from the fire. 

When you are alone fear must come and visit you. Maybe during the day, maybe at night , but it will surely come. When it does visit, be a good host, behave politely, and then let it go.
