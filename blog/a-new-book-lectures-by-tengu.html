<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>By Yossi Sheriff</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After a long wait, probably over one thousand five hundred years, a translated English version of the important and cool book by Issai Chozanshi (or as we in AKBAN call him â€“ I.) has been published.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the book you can read lectures by a Tengu (or as we call him â€“ T.), the mythological demon who began teaching of Ninjutsu, and to whom we owe our kata.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not many martial arts pride themselves with the fact that their prime teacher is a crow-like demon â€“ we do â€“ what other choice do we have.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The book, by the way, is serious and important, and should join the bookshelf of every Akbanaut, which should already include â€œHagakureâ€, â€œGo Rin No Shuâ€, and, of course, â€œFoot on the pathâ€ and â€œTree climbing for pedestriansâ€.</p>
