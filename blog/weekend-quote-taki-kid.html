So my psychologist friend tells me one day about one of her patients, a small child. She works with kids and uses play as a method of communicating with them. 

“This kid”, she sighs, “drove me crazy”. “Session after session after session he just played Taki. Now, I am used to some kids mainly playing and not speaking, but this was too much. Comes in, lets me deal the cards, and plays the whole session.”

“Last week I couldn’t stand this any longer and I asked him, “What is the matter? why do we play cards all the time? why only Taki?” 

“And what did he say? “ I ask her, 

“He stops playing, puts the cards down and looks at me for a long moment, he then says: “<b>A person has to know how to play with the cards he gets</b>”.
