Exarcheia neighbourhood in Athens is Tel Aviv, 50 years ago. The faces of the old people in the streets, grandmothers carrying baskets from the market, slowly climbing the steep streets, the bookshops, the aromas of family cooking at noon, I am sure I smelled Kaptadakya and Pastitsio. 

I came for the winter seminar armed with Gaby Frischlander. Gaby is the senior teacher in Niradin, a Doron Navon Shodan and an AKBAN Nidan. Gaby came to test Vasilis and Aris for senior instructor level together with me. 

Gaby and me have been friends for more then forty years. We are older now, but we used to play hide and seek in the workers' neighbourhood, fought in the same elementary school, heard music in the same high school parties and stood in awe in the same dojo. Simple things, same old Seiko watch, same old shoes that I mend all the time, same jeans, same morning training routine. 

Will power, courage and dedication. This combination of characteristics is not rare, we see it in many dojos. What is rare is something that we saw in the <a href="https://www.detant.org/eng">Detant</a> workshop, something unique to the Greek dojo, a degree of spirituality. Economical hardship, creates, in some people, wealth.

I honor this combination of courage and spirituality. Alchemists' gold is not dependent on loans from corporations, it stems from correct work, respect and awareness. 

New year is coming, with new challenges. Whenever I go on a new hike I take many looks back, to see where I came from, old knowledge, old techniques, old friends.  

For the new year here's what I send to all who work: Get over difficulties, practice daily,  breath deeply, thank you, Ευχαριστώ πολύ!
