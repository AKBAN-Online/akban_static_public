Qian Daliang, general manager of the Henan Shaolin Temple Development Co. Ltd, said earlier this month: "<a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-10/06/content_6839246.htm"> Shaolin Wushu, as a cultural heritage, cannot be equal to competitive sports</a>. They are two completely different concepts. They are all monks at Shaolin Temple, we cannot send them to take part in competitions." 
The Shaolin monastery has been rebuilt after it was demolished in the cultural revolution and is now the training place of a community of monks dedicated to Zen Buddhism and martial arts practice.
