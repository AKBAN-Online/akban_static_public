July the 2nd, at China's Guizhou Normal University was the scene of a brutal knife attack. A mentally disturbed student armed with a 50 cm, large machete like knife barged into the campus towards the cafeteria. As the security guards were trying to stop him, two were stabbed to death.

What we can see in the car's side view mirror is a Kong Fu practitioner (probably Zhang Huaiqian) waiting patiently for the correct moment. The attacker that uses a long pole at the beginning draws the knife, turns around and stabs the security guard, when he turns away the Kong fu hero proceeds to knock him down with a high flying <a title="Ninjutsu kicks" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Kicks">kick</a> and then proceeds, with several bystanders, to strike the attacker into submission.

A truly brave display of courage and ability.
