Will power is a muscle, if you train it it will get strong. This is also a benefit of the journeys. 

At the hours when you find it tough and you are tired of walking or when you need to prepare dinner and you feel you only want to sleep - this is the way the will power muscle grows stronger. 

At states of frustration, in a boring walk or when we walk for hours without eating and we do not give up and explode at each other or on ourselves - this is the way that the will power muscle grows and develops. 

This is how you learn to control your ship's helm and to direct it to anywhere you choose.
