Corporal Aviram Shavit, of the AKBAN Jerusalem dojo, died this week in service. He was 19 years old. Aviram was buried this Thursday, 17, August, 2017, at the military cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. 

The AKBAN family and me are sad beyond words at the loss of this good hearted friend and an able warrior.
