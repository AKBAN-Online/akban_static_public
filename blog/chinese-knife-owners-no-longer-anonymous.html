In a move aimed at reducing violence in the lead up to the coming world Olympics, China has decreed that citizens must register their identities when buying potentially dangerous knives.

<div class="quote">"The targeted daggers include those with blood grooves, lock-knives, and knives with blades measuring over 22 centimeters, the ministry said in a circular posted on its website, www.mps.gov.cn."</div>


Probably a good idea, a simple scuffle can quickly escalate into a very bloody affair with the help of a knife. Not that only "dangerous" knives can cause serious injuries. 

Sadly, US citizens can only dream of this kind of law, as even firearms regulations in the states are lax.
