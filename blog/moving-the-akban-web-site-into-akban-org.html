We are moving this huge martial arts site from the ninjutsu.co.il to akban.org   
There are many reasons for this move but the main one is our rapid growth from  Ninjutsu/Budo taijutsu web site into a more comprehensive martial arts website. 
We'll be having a redirect service working in the next few hours so if you are being nostalgic and click the old urls you'll be redirected.
