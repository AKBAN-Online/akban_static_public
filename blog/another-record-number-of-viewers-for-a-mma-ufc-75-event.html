September 11th, 2007, was another record high for what emerges to be the 21st century top rising spectator sport: The mixed martial arts.  
A record number of 4.7 million viewers <a href="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=7748"> watched the UFC 75 event at the cable and online TV</a>, these numbers  peaked at 5.6 million people for the bout between UFC light heavyweight champion Quinton “Rampage” Jackson and PRIDE champ Dan Henderson.  
The important demographic fact is that these viewers were mainly young men between the ages of 18-45, just the ages most advertisers seek.

This surpassed any other sport event for this period of the year and leads the way towards more money invested at the MMA sport, money that will treacle down to better fighters, better training methods and a wider participating audience.  The MMA field is destined to be one of the most promising sports in the 21st century.
