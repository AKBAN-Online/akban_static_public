The ACT school of fighting specializes in several weapons: Katana, two handed European Sword, Spear, knife, Jo and many more. Sparring in the ACT tradition is done using exact replicas and restorations of the original weapons, mimicking weight and balance. All the fighting is full force full contact. 
The veterans of ACT use <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Fechtbuch"> ancient manuscripts and existing knowledge</a> to check and restore past techniques and integrate these into a working method that is applicable in fighting, similar to what is <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Kata_analysis"> being done in AKBAN</a>.  
The first AKBAN meisterhau seminar will take place this Saturday, the 10th of November in the Tel Aviv Dojo.<div class="date">06/11/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Inside dojo">Inside dojo</a>, <a data-tag="Author:Shimi Blat">Author:Shimi Blat</a></div>
