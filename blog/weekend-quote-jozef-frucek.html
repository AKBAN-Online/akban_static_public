When you have pain, you have to work.
When you have an injury, you have to work.
It's not by restricting motion you become more healthy.
They say, if you have pain in the knee then rest. No.

If you have pain in the knee work what you work with less intensity and find where you do wrong mechanics.
Otherwise you will never solve the problem. 
You will take a break, you will come recovered, but eventually it's going to come back,
because you didn't change any thing. 

*<b>One important point</b> (Yossi S.): In case of an injury or pain one has to tell his instructor and get a medical exam. Any easy session, like Jozef prescribes, only under the supervision of a qualified Physical Therapist.
