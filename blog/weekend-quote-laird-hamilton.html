First of all don't ever practice for something you don't want to happen in the first place. I mean, I see guys training like, "I can hold my breath for five minutes underwater with a rock!" I don't ever want to consciously think I could hold my breath for that long. 
Don't prepare for something you don't want to ever happen. I think that's a big mistake.
