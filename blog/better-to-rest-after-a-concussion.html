Recent research discovered that it may be better to refrain from sports and "high-intensity activities" in the period after a concussion.

Tara Parker-Pope writes:
<div class="quote">"The researchers tracked the medical records and activity levels of 95 student athletes, including 15 girls, who had suffered concussions in school sports. The students were evaluated using cognitive tests immediately after the concussion and in follow-up visits. The data showed that athletes who engaged in the highest level of activity soon after the initial injury tended to demonstrate the worst neurocognitive scores and slowest reaction times. Students fared better if they didnâ€™t return immediately to their sport but instead simply engaged in normal school and home activities."</div>
