Rituals have energy, but the proper routine has hidden power. A training regime that is going on correctly is the engine of a long train whose cars will push to keep moving even if the locomotive thinks about stopping.

Our routine, at the beginning of every fall, is a reminder. We walk on an ancient trail that went on for hundreds of years, a path whose song line I received from my teacher, Doron Navon, a path of martial arts practice. On this centuries-old road, weapons have changed, enemies became friends and we do not yet know what foxes we will see, what hides behind the curve. Modernity makes old paths disappear, sometimes it's unseen, hardly threaded. 

It's not enough to walk, you have to walk in a certain style. It's important to know what language we speak, what is my family name, what is your family name, what is our family name, what is our uniform, where we did start and where we will not set foot.

This reminder is a choice, this choice is not comfortable.

In AKBAN we wear black gi. Beginners wear pants and upper jacket, advanced practitioners, from three years onward, wear the Hakama, Japanese combat skirt. On the chest, on the left side, an embroidered Akban Kamon.

This is how we start training from tomorrow, September 2017 till July 2018, preparing for the next Blitz. 

This is the 31st year I teach. This is ritual and the routine of what we do. 

Black pants and Gi jacket for beginners, and for veterans, black Hakama, black Gi.
