Until suddenly his ear hears the secret sound it is expecting and his eye sees the inner form that has been waiting to apear. 

Yet on the surface all the steps must be concret, rational. Questions of visibility, pace, clarity, articulation, energy, musicality, variety, rhythm - these all need to be observed in a strictly practical and professional way. 

The work is the work of an artisan, there is no place for false mystification, for spurious magical methods. 

The theater is a craft. A director works and listens. He helps the actors to work and listen. This is the guide. This is why a constantly changing process is not a process of confusion but one of growth. 

This is the key. This is the secret. As you see, there are no secrets.
