Three basic instructions to help you out with the practice of mindfulness:
Number one,
<b>Anything that arises in your experience, you can observe.</b>
Anything that arises in your experience - right now, if you feel your body, your mind, whatever, there is something happening in your experience, physical sensations, feelings, the mind is angry or happy or whatever - if you can observe that, it's good. Anything that arises in your experience you can take as an object of meditation, you can observe it. Pressure here, I can take that as a meditation, my object of meditation. Anything that arises you can observe.

&nbsp;

Number two,
<b>Anything that you can observe isn't you.</b>
Anything that you can see in your experience is not you. That one goes deep. You think, oh, what ever, that's me, wherever I'm at, here, the part of me that's here, that I'm hiding, if I can see that as a meditative object, it's not me anymore, it's not me. It's an object in my experience, but it's not me. So, anything you can observe, it's not who you are fundamentally.

&nbsp;

Number three
<b>Everything can be observed.</b>
And the last point is that everything can be observed. Everything can be observed, Everything can be observed. Everything can be taken as an object of observation. Even the sense of self, the most fundamental sense of who you are, with a little bit of practice can detach and be observed with mindfulness.
