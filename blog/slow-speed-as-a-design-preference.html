<p><strong>How do sloths inspire SlothBot’s functionality?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Its motions are governed by what we call survival constraints. These constraints ensure that the SlothBot is always able to get to a sunny spot to recharge. The actual performance objective that we have given to the robot is to minimize energy consumption, i.e., to simply do nothing subject to the survival constraints. The majority of the time, the robot simply sits there under the trees, measuring various things, seemingly doing absolutely nothing and being rather sloth-like. Whenever the SlothBot does move, it does not move according to some fixed schedule. Instead, it moves because it has to in order to “survive.”<br>(<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/why-we-need-robot-sloths">Link</a>) </p>
