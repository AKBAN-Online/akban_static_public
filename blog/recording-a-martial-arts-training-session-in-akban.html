In the years that passed since the founding of the Akban traditional MMA school we did countless training sessions in various terrains and weather situations. We did want to record, on video, a typical in-dojo training.  
On this very big website we have countless videos of martial art techniques we created and uploaded for our <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"> martial arts encyclopedia</a>, we do not have many videos depicting a training session. We figured that the challenge is to capture both the silence, the beauty and the down-to-earth approach we have here, in Akban.   
Instead of boasting we chose to understate the randori, kata and all the other stuff. Did we do it well? The question of how to video accurately our martial art is a big one. Even though we love Bruce Lee we are quite sure day to day training doesn't look like a movie. Well, enough said, here it is.
