<p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;"><strong>By Yossi Sheriff</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;">The most important book for martial arts practitioners was probably once, before the www, the yellow pages. It symbolized the making true of fantasies, the decision to actually practice, to find an instructor.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;">When I started there were no "Yellow pages", I started training in Doron Navon's dojo in the seventies following a friend's recommendation. I stayed only to find out that many books provide inspiration but none helped in dealing with the most difficult objects.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;">One book helped me and still does, so I add my recommendation to more than 600 readers in Amazon.com. Many recomended it for its buisness promoting side but for me it emphasized two new things - communicating and working with people and learning to rest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; text-align: left;">No mystical revelations, no weight loss promises, just work. Good book for carpenters or for martial arts practitioners. Good book.</p>
