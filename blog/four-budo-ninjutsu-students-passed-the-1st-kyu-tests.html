Four students passed the brown belt tests with flying colors. 
These tests necessitate more then 6-7 years of dojo training and are a preliminary to the long time it takes (13 years)to collect enough experience for the 1st Dan (black belt) in dojos that graduated the Akban school. 
Three veterans oversaw the tests that included all of the 1st kyu material in the test book.

Not all schools need such a long time to prepare the students. We do and we still have mixed feelings about it.<div class="date">15/04/2008</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Belt exams">Belt exams</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Yossi Sheriff">Author: Yossi Sheriff</a></div>
