I think he didn't stop in time. He took the Ninjutsu, which is not the best practice there is, and turned it into something very beautiful. I learned from his teachers, Masaaki Hatsumi and especially Tanemura - what Doron did from this here was, to my opinion, much better then the original, really, on a different, higher level.
