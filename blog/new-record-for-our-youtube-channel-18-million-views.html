Today, November the 18th, I checked out, as usual, all the knowledge assets I have been publishing over the last ten or more years. 

I answered comments, sent some mails and then peeked at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L3l4uEFkY8J71i5G7ovOA">AKBAN Youtube counter</a>. Nice coincidence - 18,000,000 views and going strong. 

With a modest subscriber base of 29,000 in YouTube and about 21,000 monthly unique readers on the akban.org site. 

In a time of dramatic changes it makes me happy to see that my stable dedication to my students and to our martial art is rewarded with such positive vibrations. 

I send big Thank You to all my students in the dojo and in the world wide dojo. Practice safely, and keep on training!
