What disappeared from our culture and most martial arts, and what we are desperately trying to save in our dojos, is the connection to nature.

Nature begins with being outside, walking outside.

Many activities have become a gym activities, boxed existence. In ancient Japanese budo, pupils used to walk for days just to reach a teacher. The necessity of moving on foot, to this day, for many people. Walking outside is a part of the human heritage that is becoming a novelty. Just as we preserve ancient martial traditions we should preserve this outside backdrop. The outside was once ingrained in our lives and so taken for granted, now we make the effort, even if it is on a hot summer day. So on many levels, just being outside, moving outside, without vehicles should be top priority because of mental health, physical health, martial abilities and ethics of mutual interdependence. So on many levels, just being outside, moving outside, without vehicles, or air condition, should be top priority because of mental health, physical health, martial abilities and ethics of mutual interdependence.

I will give a name for this treatment, I call it: “Respect”. Respect like this is the un-necessary, the un-reasonable, the un-expected respect and thus – a rare commodity.

Usually respect is directed to another human being as an expression of hierarchy and that person’s social status. But there is another form of respect. In the old school regime, respect is expressed also to a technique, an object, to a way of life. Through the observation and the action one can practice respect to movement, to someone, to something.

This week we will be training outside on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem groups. Hakama, battle skirt is only needed on the weapon classes. On other sessions, please bring punching equipment, water and extreme fitness.
