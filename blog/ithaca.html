<p align="right" style="text-align: left" dir="rtl" class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black" dir="ltr">By Konstantinos Kavafis</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: black" dir="ltr"> (1863-1933)</span><span dir="ltr"></span></p>

</p><p align="right" style="text-align: left" dir="rtl" class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">When you set out on your journey to </span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">Ithaca</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">,
pray that the road is long,<br />
full of adventure, full of knowledge.<br />
The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,<br />
the angry Poseidon -- do not fear them:<br />
You will never find such as these on your path,<br />
if your thoughts remain lofty, if a fine<br />
emotion touches your spirit and your body.<br />
The Lestrygonians and the Cyclops,<br />
the fierce Poseidon you will never encounter,<br />
if you do not carry them within your soul,<br />
if your soul does not set them up before you.<br />
<br /><br />
Pray that the road is long.<br />
That the summer mornings are many, when,<br />
with such pleasure, with such joy<br />
you will enter ports seen for the first time;<br />
stop at Phoenician markets,<br />
and purchase fine merchandise,<br />
mother-of-pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br />
and sensual perfumes of all kinds,<br />
as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br />
visit many Egyptian cities,<br />
to learn and learn from scholars.<br />
<br /><br />
Always keep </span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">Ithaca</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr"> in your mind.<br />
To arrive there is your ultimate goal.<br />
But do not hurry the voyage at all.<br />
It is better to let it last for many years;<br />
and to anchor at the island when you are old,<br />
rich with all you have gained on the way,<br />
not expecting that </span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">Ithaca</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr"> will offer you riches.<br /><br />

</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">Ithaca</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr"> has given you the beautiful voyage.
Without her you would have never set out on the road.<br />
She has nothing more to give you.<br />

And if you find her poor, </span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr">Ithaca</span><span style="color: black" dir="ltr"> has not deceived you.<br />
Wise as you have become, with so much experience,<br />
you must already have understood what Ithacas mean.<br />
