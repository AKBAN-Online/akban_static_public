We got used to think that giving is the result of love, for to that which a man loves, he gives. But the second Theory is this, that a man loves the fruit of his deeds, for he feels a part of his self in them - if it is a son he fathered or trained, or an animal he raised, or a seedling he planted, or even an inanimate object, like a house he built, - there he is, attached to the fruits of his labor in love, for he finds himself in them.
