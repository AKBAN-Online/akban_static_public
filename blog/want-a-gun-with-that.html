While the Chinese are busy <a href="http://www.akban.org/article/354/chinese-knife-owners-no-longer-anonymous"> regulating knife sales</a>, Kansas car dealers are giving away guns with every purchase:

<div class="quote">"Max Motors, a small Butler, Missouri dealership that has as its logo a grimacing cowboy wielding a pistol, has sold more than 30 cars and trucks in the last three days, far more than its normal volume. And owner Mark Muller credits his decision to start offering buyers their choice of a $250 gas card or a $250 credit at a gun shop."</div>


Just how effective <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Portal:Traditional_weapons"> traditional weapons</a> would be against an armed truck driver is quite obvious. Instead, I think this is a job for the Ninjutsu ("martial art of distance") technique "distancing one's self from Kansas".
