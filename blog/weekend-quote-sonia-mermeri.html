When I came to Tel Aviv and started learning at the University, I could enjoy at least three scholarships: Eastern Jews, Jews from Morocco, and students from border towns. I chose to volunteer in an education project and went to the "Tikva" neighborhood to tutor a Yemenite girl there. 

Her father told me a story that I can not forget: He and his best friend got out of the army together, years ago. His friend used the grant money to buy shares in the bus company, he bought a sewing machine. With this decision he sealed his fate. He became the neighborhood tailor, and barely made a living. Social mobility is not only who marries who, it is many small decisions that happen in a person's life.
