Kaloyan Mahlyanov, known with his Sumo name Kotooshu, made history, For the First Time a European Wins the Emperor's Cup. 

Kotooshu, a Bulgarian, became the first European sumo fighter  who won the Emperor's Cup after winning the 2008 May Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.

<div class="quote">"I'm so happy," a beaming Kotooshu told Japan's NHK television after becoming the seventh foreigner to win an Emperor's Cup. "I'm speechless. I did it at last."</div>


If Kotooshu, an ozeki ranked fighter, wins the Nagoya tournament he could rise to the esteemed rank of yokozuna.
