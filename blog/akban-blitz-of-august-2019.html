Today, August the 1st, we start the AKBAN Blitz in the dojo. 

The Group will train in two parallel paths: all session randori and aerobic Daken Taijutsu. 

The choice of path is an AND Gate of the practitioner and me. Within the confines of the Gate one can move from one path to the other.   

Those that have been at it for more than 30 years, do the same, Himum, Kamae and randori the whole session. For those that joined us this year, we video the randori for debriefing, slow motion it and send it individually to the practitioners. 

Things to bring: No Hakama, just long pants and black teeshirt. Please bring full boxing gloves and water.
