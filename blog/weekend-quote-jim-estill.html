Some tips from Jim Estill <a href="http://jimestill2.blogspot.co.il/2016/09/dealing-with-conditions.html">post</a> for dealing with Conditions:

1 - Compartmentalize.  Often the Condition is high stress.  Once you have done all you can do.  Leave it.  Do something to take your mind off it.  Try to not let it spill into other compartments of your life.

2 - Choose your reaction.  Often the reaction chosen can hurt you even more than the condition.  This is like the person who chooses to say "my life if ruined because...".  Why do they choose to let the Condition ruin their life.  The more they assume they have no choice but to take the reaction they have the more helpless they are.

3 - Count your blessings.  Most Conditions are not as catastrophic as we imagine.  As Mark Twain said "I have suffered from a lot of worries in my life - a few of which actually happened".  The grateful in this world are happier and more in control.

4 - Help someone who is worse off than yourself.  This helps with gratefulness.  Focus on someone else.

5 - Focus on making another part of your life better.  Just because a Condition happened in one area does not mean you need it to poison all of life.  Often you can build better in another area.

6 - Be logical.  Often by exaggerating what it really means, you can see that it is not as big of a deal as it feels like at the time.  Sometimes a calm and insightful mentor can help this.

7 - Break a sweat.  I find there is nothing like a good workout to help me get perspective back.  And there is no downside.

8 - Control what you can.  Even though the nature of Conditions is you cannot control them, there often are parts of it or other things you can control.  Control gives hope and a part of us always like to be "doing something to fix it".

9 - Take a break.  Often the weight of the condition colours our whole view on life.  If you have already done what you can, take a break.  Breaks rejuvenate.  Figure out what rejuvenates you.
