A strange one indeed, apparently strobe lights are the police force's weapon of the future. As explained on NewScientist:

<div class="quote">"Wielded like a conventional gun, this weapon is designed to trigger "flicker illness" - a condition akin to severe motion sickness - which leaves the target dazed, nauseous or completely immobilised. Its developers suggest it could be just the thing for disabling armed criminals or dispersing a rioting mob. If all goes to plan, police and border guards could soon be using the weapon in earnest."</div>


And here I was thinking of a future with sinister looking high-powered laser guns.

They should also play some 70's disco B-side music as an accompaniment, so as to further shock the target.
