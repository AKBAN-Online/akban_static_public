- <em>I don't want to practice today...I don't care about stupid wooden swords...</em>

You are troubled. Good, trouble is the perfect time to train. When you're dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this not when fighting happens.

-<em>I do not like dolls and kittens...</em></br>
You are not here, you're with your trouble. If you're with your troubles when fighting happens... more trouble for you. 
Tsk, tsk. Just so, how can you be quick as a snake, quite as a shadow, when you're somewhere else. 
You are fearing for your father, that is right. Do you pray to the gods? </br>
-<em>The old and the new.</em></br>
There is only one god, and his name is death. And there is only one thing we say to death: "Not today".
