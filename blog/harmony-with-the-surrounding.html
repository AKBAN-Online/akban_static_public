<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">In every visit to Sinai, I felt that this desert carries a different and sometimes enchanting flow of life. Good karma goes a long way there. Nir Unger and I were on our way to Muhammad's family near Santa Katrina, when we met on the beach with an expert on finding water, a real dowser, there by invitation of the Egyptian government. He was invited to help locate water in the arid expanses of Sinai. He was also on his way to meet Muhammad, who is known and respected throughout Sinai. Andre, Nir and I were in a minibus loaded with groceries for the family when it started to drizzle. Water came down from the sky after a dry spell of years. Although not a torrent, the drizzle signified to me that this visit will be extraordinary.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="rtl" lang="HE"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">There are states in which we perform well, with accuracy and correctness and there are states in which things are done in true harmony with others and the environment. Not unlike a Jazz jam session or sparring with and old friend, like a song that resonates off distant cliffs or a physical structure which blends with its surroundings and reflects its location.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="rtl" lang="HE"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">Shortly before sunset, after tea and a rest from the drive, Muhammad asked Andre the dowser to come down with him to his wadi behind the family's home. He suspected there was water there and wished to know what Andre thought of it. Andre can describe where the underground water stream starts and ends, he can determine the kind of rock that will be dug up and the salinity of the water below, as well as the depth of the water basin. We went down to the wadi, Muhammad, Andre, Nir, Salah <span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr">(an old friend of M) and myself with a camera to record the search for water.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="rtl" lang="HE"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">After returning to Tel Aviv I was editing the footage while in the background Caetano Veloso was singing "Maria Bonita". The song somehow felt right for the piece and I simply pasted it into the clip. The result was beautiful. First, I saw how Andre was actually dancing his explanations to Muhammad while sensing the water below in eerie synch to the music. Next I noticed that all persons present (including the cameraman with his pans and zooms) were "dancing" in a kind of non-verbal communication and without audible music, but in a harmony that cannot be ignored.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="rtl" lang="HE"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr">3 things were common to everyone present there: Firstly, all were types of warriors - Andre having an extensive background in Aikido, Nir in Ninjutsu, Muai Thai and various Chinese internal martial arts, myself and the two Bedouins whose very lives in the desert represented the warrior's way. Secondly, I think it was a common love of humanity and nature. Thirdly, we were all there to give some kind of service, Andre, Nir and myself to Muhammad and Salah, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal"><span dir="rtl" lang="HE"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">Trying to narrow it further, I could say that all were persons connected to themselves. People who feel at peace in their inner homes, whether from living a spiritually clean life in the desert as our two old Bedouin friends, or by learning Maharaji's meditations<span dir="ltr"> </span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr"></span><span dir="ltr">(as I did) or through whichever spoke of the wheel they traveled to get to the center.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">If we use the wheel as an analogy to life, then outside, furthest away from the center, life is fast and turbulent but closer you get to the center, things slow down. At the very center the movement stops altogether and, in fact, a new reality presents itself, one that is different from the one we are used to experiencing in our daily lives.<span dir="rtl" lang="HE"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed" dir="ltr" class="MsoNormal">The wheel has many spokes leading from outward within. The paths are many but in the center all differences are removed. That is the moment we experienced in this video clip.</p>
