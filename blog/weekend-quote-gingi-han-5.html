These are the roots of the teacher's work: 
Kata, Randori and Mondo.

<b>Kata</b> is the seal of order.
<b>Randori</b> is the meeting place of chaos and order. 
<b>Mondo</b> is needed to explain to the thinking part what is happening in the doing part. 

These roots must be watered by constant respect, respect for others, respect for the insights and respect for one's own constituents.
