<p>From time to time I face the question: "why do I train?"</p>
<p>My friends, even strangers and of course my wife ask me on many occasions.</p>
<p>When I began to train, I was 14 then, my answer was â€œbecause I want to remain the only secular Jew in Jerusalemâ€.  This was right after reading â€œJeremiahâ€™s innâ€ (a satirical book by Israeli author Benjamin Tamuz), I was so enraged by it that I wanted to be strong enough to stand my ground.</p>
<p>Thus, training rigorously, I became strong (I also understood that this would not make any difference, but this is another story altogether).</p>
<p>Upon understanding I had indeed become strong (this took several years) I realized something additional; I realized I was training because training was fulfilling a very basic need for me, maybe even a primitive need.  This primitive desire is to engage my body in fighting, playing and sweating.</p>
<p>Defining myself as a man (not to mention a machoâ€¦) includes my physical ability and my readiness to use my force in order to defend and attack at need.</p>
<p>Practice provides me with a suitable feeling.  This requires constant upkeep.  I am aware: this is a primitive feeling. I could always be defeated by a bullet shot by anyone, but this does not matter. The Power, the ability to control my body, and if needed (theoretically) control others, provides me with what I need in order to feel good and whole (in this matter, at least).</p>
<p>If one looks deep enough, all of our desires and feelings have this primitive basis (at times this does not even require too much introspection).<br />
There is an entire field in Psychology (a much disputed field), emphasizing â€œthe evolutionary approachâ€, maybe its perspectives are relevant here. Many psychologists agree: we are driven by primal impulses and desires in a more powerful manner than most of us are willing to admit.</p>
<p>After practice I feel like a lion.  This feeling is wonderful.  This is an another excellent reason to train in martial arts.</p><div class="date">27/02/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Blog">Blog</a>, <a data-tag="thinktank">thinktank</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Lior Katz">Author: Lior Katz</a></div>
