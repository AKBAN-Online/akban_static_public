Every year I make it a point to donate my time for some kids who want to learn martial arts and can not afford to pay for it. 

This makes me happy and this way I return the gift my instructor, <a href="http://www.akban.org/doron-navon-the-first-foreign-bujinkan-shihan" title="Doron Navon Shihan">Doron Navon</a>, once gave me when he allowed me to train even though my mother did not have enough to pay for dojo fees. 

This year I am fortunate enough to be teaching a wonderful youth group in Tel Aviv, about thirty kids. 

My friend, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shai.reshef">Shai Reshef</a>, sees a far horizon from his lofty perspective, he sees more then 30 kids, he sees a change. He once told me: "I want people to be able to learn higher education, not only read the news". 

And that's what he did, after only three years he built the world's accredited people's University that teaches students from Israel, Haiti, Egypt, well, actually from every country where there are students who can not afford University tuition. 1200 students from 121 countries, so far. 

Every dollar contributed to the <a href="http://www.uopeople.org/" title="University Of the People" target="_blank">www.uopeople.org</a> pays the tuition of an able student who would otherwise be doomed to a life of cultural and economic poverty. 

I think my teacher would have approved. I intend to donate not only time but money in this round of contributions. Maybe you would choose to do the same.
