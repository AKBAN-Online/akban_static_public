Know that men become what they do, and their heart and all their thoughts always follow their deeds, be they good or evil. 

And even a complete villain that thinks evil all day long, if he will pour his spirit and try and persist in good deeds, even if it is from the wrong causes, he will immediately lean into goodness, even if not intending so, and with the power of his deeds and actions he will suffocate his evil inclination because hearts follow deeds. 

And even a complete zadik, a righteous person, with straight and pure heart who is seeking good thoughts and occupations, if he will always be involved with bad deeds - maybe because the king forced him to do so and told him to be busy only with bad work, if he will fully occupy himself all day with that art - he will one day turn full circle from righteousness of heart to become completely bad.
