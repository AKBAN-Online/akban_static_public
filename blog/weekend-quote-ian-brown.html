For each a road
For every-man a religion
Find everybody and rule
For everything and rumble
Forget everything and remember
For everything a reason
Forgive everybody and remember
For each a road
For every-man a religion
Face everybody and rule
For everything and rumble
Forget everything and remember
For everything a reason

You got the fear...
F.E.A.R. (You got the fear) ...

Final eternity arouses reactions
Freeing excellence affects reality
Fallen empires are ruling
Find earth and reef

Fantastic expectations
Amazing revelations
Final execution and resurrection
Free expression as revolution
Finding everything and realizing

You got the fear ...
F.E.A.R. (You got the fear) ...

(Fantastic expectations
Amazing revelations
Finding everything and realizing
For everything a reason)

F.E.A.R. (You got the fear) ...
You got the fear ...
