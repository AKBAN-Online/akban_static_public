Heisenberg’s celebrity uncertainty principle states that the more closely you observe a celebrity, the less accurate the image becomes,
A celebrity cannot be observed and accurately reported simultaneously. The act of observing a celebrity makes accuracy impossible, and conversely getting to the truth of a celebrity makes observation impossible, most likely because they’re locked behind closed doors.
