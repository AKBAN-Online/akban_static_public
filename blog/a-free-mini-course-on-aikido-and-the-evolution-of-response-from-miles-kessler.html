Hello All,

This is a personal message from me, Yossi,
I wanted to let you know about a great learning opportunity that has just come out from my friend Miles Kessler and the Integral Dojo. He has just released a free mini-course on Aikido and the "Evolution Of Response". This is a 3-part video series and it is full of great teaching content about about development in Aikido, and it also includes helpful reference guides to illuminate the Path of practice.

Miles is an innovative Martial arts teacher with years of experience and also a certified Dharma teacher who already lead a meditation seminar in AKBAN.

This free video mini-series will give you a wonderful way to apply Aikido and Budo principles to your life. The free video and reference guide will only be available for a few days only so be sure to check it out while you can.
