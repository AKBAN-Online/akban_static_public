There's a myth, among some of the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Historical_martial_arts_reconstruction">HEMA</a> practitioners, that, because the source is older it is somehow more authentic, or more authoritative, and that's not necessarily true. 

What goes hand in hand with that is the idea that just because it was written down in the past, means that it's unquestionable source, which again is not always true. 

There were bad fencers in the past just like there are bad fencers today.
