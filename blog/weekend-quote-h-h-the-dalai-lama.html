The Dalai Lama</h1></header>
 

Never give up 
No matter what is going on 
Never give up 
Develop the heart. Too much energy in your country is spent Developing the mind instead of the heart. 
Be compassionate not just to your friends but to everyone 
Be compassionate. 
Work for peace in your heart and in the world. 
Work for peace and I say again 
Never give up. 
No matter what is happening, No matter what is going on around you, 
Never give up.
