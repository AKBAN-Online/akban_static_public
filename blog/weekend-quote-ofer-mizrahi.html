Yesterday I went to Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital because of a chest injury. Yes, a successful <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Black_belt,_1st_Dan_syllabus_-_Ninjutsu" title="Black belt exam">Black belt exam</a>, less successful single fall. 
We set there, Etgar and me, in the Emergency room, drinking cold water from tiny laboratory plastic cups. Not exactly "<a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Our_water" title="Our water">Our water</a>", but still…

And yes, it was a good exam. 

I recalled we used to drink Whiskey in dire straits, before Yossi started to abstain. Etgar told me stories and I told him about my previous teacher whom I angrily left after he screwed - up, misconduct that is. 

It was a big fall then, almost 12 years since. A big lesson, but I am still standing and breathing, carefully. 

This is the chain of events when you get injured in the dojo. First, on a small yellow and wrinkled paper, Professor H. writes an urgent letter to the hospital. At the hospital Dr. Noam, the same guy from <a href="http://www.akban.org/news/quote-ofer" title="previous">my previous ailment</a>, smiles, looks at it and says: “so you are the injured Judoka, I should have guessed it’s someone from the dojo. He then takes me to the C.T., checks the results, smiles again and looks worried. 

And Yossi. Yossi is awake till 3 AM, gets all the results, answers questions succinctly and feels that he had to come and not only because he invested 12 dojo years in me. 

Just a sparring session, but still… 

Then later, in the morning, at home, I feel like the twin towers but with a major difference, I am still standing. 

And I read what Yossi <a href="http://www.akban.org/hebrew/news/yaakov-hazan" title="יעקב חזן">wrote to Yakov Hazan</a>, and what Yakov wrote, and I think. I think about persistence and falls that are actually stances. 
And about disappointment with some teachers
and falls in business 
and life falls
and finally falls at the belt exam. 

And I understand that <b>the form of the fall is less important than the way you stand and fight again</b>, and the lesson you learned about life when every breath was a painful chore, and laughing was excruciatingly impossible. 

It will be only a short while before we drink the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Our_water" title="Our water">water</a> Yossi carried on his back.
