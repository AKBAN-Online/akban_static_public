D. Ouspensky</h1></header>
 

Everything 'happens'. People can 'do' nothing. From the time we are born to the time we die things happen, happen, happen, and we think we are doing. 

This is our normal state in life, and even the smallest possibility to do something comes only through the work, and first only in oneself, not externally. 

 
From: A Further Record, By P. D. Ouspensky
