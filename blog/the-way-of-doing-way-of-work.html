Budo Ninjutsu is doing with the body, doing physical work.

Although Martial art helps us develop and maintain strength, power, speed, physical and mental health and ultimately becoming fierce warriors, most of these fade in time.
We can only hope for "somethingâ€ to accumulate over time. This sediment presents itself to us under the Japanese mantle: Do.

Simply put, Do is the Way, the Path, and the path requires work.

At the end what remains is the "Do". What this means for us is that the effort is lifelong.

There is no "Kfitzat Haderech" here, this path has no shortcuts, although there will be times when progress will come in jumps, when small understandings will lead to bigger understandings.<div class="date">18/10/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Blog">Blog</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Yossi Sheriff">Author: Yossi Sheriff</a>, <a data-tag="thinktank">thinktank</a></div>
