<p style="text-align: justify;">One practitioner, the head-teacher of a Zen temple, was trying to make a sign for the temple’s gate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Calligraphy is Dō. More accurately it’s a Dō called Shodō. I think it's interesting that calligraphy is Dō not only in Japan but in many places, From the Benedictine monks in the middle-ages, through the beautiful Arab calligraphy and to the ancient Jewish profession of hand writing the whole Bible - Sofer Stam. Maybe that is how Dō develops, out of the need to write down a grocery list, out of the duty to write in your tax form, out of the wish to preserve the scriptures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I firmly believe that these are the precursors for Dō: when the necessary allows itself to become a matter of choice, and the will attends a repetition of that choice, morning after morning, day after day, decade after decade, Then the alchemy happens. The respect, the awareness and the repetition transform the mundane deed into gold.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These ingredients are known to every calligrapher, every Zen monk, every pianist and every Sofer Stam: repeat, attend, respect. But there is something else, I have to use a Hebrew word for this because I know of no other equivalent, I'll use the term “Kefitzat Haderech”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've read this story somewhere - Kossan dipped a huge brush into the ink.
The temple’s head student was there to assist and hand the big sheets of paper that were on the meditation room’s floor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kossan wrote down the words: “The first principle”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The student watched and said: “Not bad, but it can be a bit better”, and handed a new sheet of paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kossan concentrated, and wrote down the words: “The first principle”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The student watched and said: “this was not as good. I think the lines are a bit forced. The first one was better”.
Kossan helped move away the paper and prepared the brush for another attempt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kossan, again, wrote down the words: “The first principle”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Terrible” said the student, who probably had some Israeli hutzpa genes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kossan wrote forty-eight first principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then the student had enough of his teacher’s failures. “Excuse me, teacher”, he must have said, “I need to take a pee”, and left.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The teacher took this opportunity and with a worry-free mind he quickly wrote: “The first principle”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Wonderful!” exclaimed the student upon his return. “Masterpiece”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And it’s there, to this day to remind me: “There are no shortcuts”, but there is a Kefitzat Haderech.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the Kefitzat Haderech!</p>
