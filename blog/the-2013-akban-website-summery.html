We had 4,469,699 views of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ninjalla" title="akban youtube">AKBAN YouTube</a> channel and added 8,717 subscribers so now we are nearing 20,000 subscribers. 

I wrote more than 700 articles, posts and fitness charts dealing with Conflict management, our core martial practice - Combat oriented <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Ninjutsu" title="Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</a>,  and honed the AKBAN Hebrew fitness program (Marathon table included). 

For 2014 I plan videoing missing kata from several ryu and focusing on conflict analysis and prevention for the academy's company - <a href="http://www.detant.org/eng" title="detant">DETANT</a>.
