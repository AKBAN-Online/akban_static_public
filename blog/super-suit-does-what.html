Yet another burn-a-hole-in-the-nations-pocket military project has emerged recently, the "Raytheon Sarcos Exoskeleton". For those of you who are not familiar with sci-fi, this is the type of super strength suit the terminator's arch enemy would have been wearing.

Sounds cool, but what does it really do? As you can see in the video below, it can allow an average human being to lift large weights with the help of assisting hydraulic arms. While connected to a massive hydraulic controller of course.

Even if you overcome the challenge of powering the suit, will this sort of device not be obsolete by the time it is practical, replaced by purely robotic vehicles? Surely in it's current state it isn't much use outside the lab, and lets not go into what it looks like.

As Calvin would have said:
