I have been teaching since 1985. AKBAN dojo didn’t stop for nothing, no war, no man, no rain, we just kept coming and training. All this has changed today, I just sent a message in our private groups that there will be no training. It was tough on me, a lonely decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

We shouldn’t stop for fear for ourselves, we are strong and healthy and we have herbs and practice on our side. We should now stop for a different reason, we should stop to protect our weak, for our high risk friends or family.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

That should be our highest motive, to protect the old the weak or maybe, the unfortunate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

This virus is dangerous and limiting physical contact is our, my, responsibility. This will delay, give time and maybe even lower the possibility of getting sick.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I am sorry about the session loss, I already miss the dojo, miss you, my friends, but, I haven’t stopped training. I will upload it, I have already started uploading part of my morning routine and we will use technology to meet in spirit but maintain this discipline of protection.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Doron, my teacher told me, “When a martial arts practitioner enters the room, everyone is a little bit safer” now is the time of the paradox. The weak will be safer if we DO NOT enter the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I have been telling the veterans since January, this will be a hard fight, but we must win it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

Take care and carry your independent training kernel with you, daily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
