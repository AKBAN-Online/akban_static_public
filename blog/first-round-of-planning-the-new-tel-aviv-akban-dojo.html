Students of architecture presented the first drafts of the new Akban Academy in Tel Aviv. Yossi Sheriff, Akban's founder, commented on the interesting and successful plans: "Our martial art is the picture. I love this picture and I think that a good martial arts Centre should be the beautiful frame.  It should be approachable to students who wish to apply to our rigorous training regime".  

The current Tel Aviv dojo is spacious, has parking nearby but lacks the added benefit of daily practice. A new Academy will give the students the ability to train all week long. The opening date is scheduled for September. 

On our way to strengthen our core and our learning assets this is an important mid station. We thank the students and their teacher Michal Dolev Hashimshoni and her colleague Yehiam Kru.
