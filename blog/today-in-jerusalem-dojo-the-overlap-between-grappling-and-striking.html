I once read a great book, it was called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865680515/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=budoninjutsu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0865680515" title="Enter to Trapping to Grappling (Jeet Kune Do)" target="_blank">Enter to Trapping to Grappling</a>". In it the author developed some techniques that took Wing chun aspects of striking in close range and grappling. 

At the time, when striking arts ruled the magazines and grappling arts were a dedicated, professional but highly cloistered disciplines it was refreshing to see my teacher's atitude echoed. <a href="http://www.akban.org/doron-navon-the-first-foreign-bujinkan-shihan" title="doron navon" target="_blank">Doron Navon</a> Shihan, himself not only a Ninjutsu top teacher but a Judo 4th Dan, emphasized the necessity of grappling knowledge for all self defense situations, for <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-martial-art-to-teach-ones-child/answer/Yossi-Sheriff" title="what is the best martial art to teach ones children?" target="_blank">many reasons</a>. 

We do not need to look far, a through practice in Ninjutsu techniques reveals that a plethora of kata mix grappling, locking and throwing. 

After dedicating the previos weeks to honing sabaki and reaction we now open scope for the various ways the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Takamatsu_den_-_the_nine_systems_Ninjutsu_school" title="takamatsu den" target="_blank">Takamatsu den</a> syllabus deals with close range and middle range distances.
