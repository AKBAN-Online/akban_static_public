A Former Police Officer from Oakland Police was found guilty of manslaughter of a suspect - Oscar Grant Jr. - who was handcuffed during the act. The court ruled the sentence.  Since the officer is white and the suspect a black youngster there are concerns of racial riots in the Bay Area. This case reminds the Rodney King case that broke the Los Angeles riots in 1992. The Grant and King events were filmed by viewers. 
A paper from <a href="http://www.akban.org/blog_en/article/122"> 2007</a>, in the Journal of AKBAN, warned that the certainty of documenting personal acts must be part of the strategy of fighting, self-defense and security. ERA, <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Exposed_recorded_action"> Exposed recorded action</a>, is here to stay and planning according to this certainty is as important as preparing for the enemy’s specific weapons. The Gaza flotilla case is another fatal incidence in which not only the intelligence was lacking but the utter certainty of video documentation was not considered. Combat personnel and security forces must do the new data integration: ERA of what we do is a certainty, not an option. 
AKBAN, The Academy of martial arts, leads the integration of ERA into personal and group techniques. One of the main conclusions we’ve had is that learning and practicing with non-violent and <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Levels_of_violence"> low aggression techniques</a> improves overall target acquisition. 
In the video the officer shoots detainee's head. This is one of many videos taken by spectators in the event. The picture attached was taken by the deceased, using his cell phone, seconds before he was shot.
