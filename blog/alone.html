<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Alone, being truly alone, not lonely in an emotional sense. How often do we find ourselves alone with no one around, in a place where there are no distractions aside from thoughts?</p>
Most of us do not like being alone and steer away from it. I am not speaking of being alone at home or in the street; there we are still surrounded by everyday distractions of life: t.v., newspapers, telephones and more.
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">What then, is the meaning of being alone?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">It is much like other things that we carry out: first and foremost, it is a physical practice, something that is done with the body, not on an emotional level.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Being in a place that is cut off from people, a distant place to which you don't take any objects that might deflect attention such as a book, a newspaper or friends. What is left then are many thoughts, those that tail us and deal with simple everyday life: work, friends, and family. Then there are those that allow us to look deeper, to wonder about things that we don't usually think about since we are busy with a million other things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">In the beginning it might be upsetting to face the thoughts that arise in such a situation. However, with time I've learned that things aren't so bad, after all, there's no one who watches neither laughter nor tears, there's no one to judge.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">If you cannot go to a distant place to be alone, the physical aspect can always be reproduced in small doses, perhaps even in a dark room. If possible, it is better to get out of the house to an open field or to a place that is far away from distraction, and then do nothing but pay attention. It might be overwhelming and confusing, but in time things start making sense.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" dir="ltr" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">The practice is physical. Many times, when thoughts are confusing, we don't have to think but rather listen, listen to familiar sounds: a car, a bird singing. Then we can relax, close our eyes and eventually listen to the inside sound, to our breathing, to ourselvesâ€¦</p><div class="date">17/04/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Blog">Blog</a>, <a data-tag="thinktank">thinktank</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Zion Cohen">Author: Zion Cohen</a></div>
