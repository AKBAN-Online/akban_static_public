Cipolla</h1></header>
 

Our daily life is mostly made of cases in which we lose money and/or time and/or energy and/or appetite, cheerfulness and good health because of the improbable action of some preposterous creature who has nothing to gain and indeed gains nothing from causing us embarrassment, difficulties or harm. 

Nobody knows, understands or can possibly explain why that preposterous creature does what he does. In fact there is no explanation â€” or better, there is only one explanation: the person in question is stupid.
