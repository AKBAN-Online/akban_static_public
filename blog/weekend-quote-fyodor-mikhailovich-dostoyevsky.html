Why, to maintain this theory of the regeneration of mankind by means of the pursuit of his own advantage is to my mind
almost the same thing ... as to affirm, for instance, following Buckle, that through civilisation mankind becomes softer, and consequently less bloodthirsty and less fitted for warfare.  Logically it does seem to follow from his arguments. But man has such a predilection for systems and abstract deductions that he is ready to distort the truth intentionally, he is ready to deny the evidence of his senses only to justify his logic.  

I take this example because it is the most glaring instance of it. Only look about you: blood is being spilt in streams, and in the merriest way, as though it were champagne.  Take the whole of the nineteenth century in which Buckle lived.  Take Napoleon--the Great and also the present one.  Take North America--the eternal union. Take the farce of Schleswig-Holstein.... And what is it that civilisation softens in us?  The only gain of civilisation for mankind is the greater capacity for variety of sensations--and absolutely nothing more.  

And through the development of this many-sidedness man may come to finding enjoyment in bloodshed.  In fact, this has already happened to him.  Have you noticed that it is the most civilized gentlemen who have been the subtlest slaughterers, to whom the Attilas and Stenka Razins could not hold a candle, and if they are not so conspicuous as the Attilas and Stenka Razins it is simply because they are so often met with, are so ordinary and have become so familiar to us.  

In any case civilisation has made mankind if not more bloodthirsty, at least more vilely, more loathsomely bloodthirsty.  In old days he saw justice in bloodshed and with his conscience at peace exterminated those he thought proper.  Now we do think bloodshed abominable and yet we engage in this abomination, and with more energy than ever. Which is worse?  Decide that for yourselves.
