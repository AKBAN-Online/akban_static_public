In Japan, Kami is regarded as a type of force that exists in nature.  Sometimes it can take form, and be conceived as a real entity. But in essence  Kami is not really defined and is without form.

The word god is not a suitable translation of Kami, but in Hebrew, as well as  in English, there is no exact word for Kami, therefore, in many places Kami is  translated as a god. It is said that Japan has eight million Kami; this is to  say that Kami can be found in many places and phenomena. Certain places, objects  or natural occurrences that have a certain presence or relay a certain feeling,  can be Kami.

At times, Kami can exist even in animals and humans. Often people with  special powers become Kami when they die. Some of the founders of different  schools of martial arts in Japan are considered Kami. Kami is always related to  nature, it is the epiphany of nature. The movie <a href="http://www.princess-mononoke.com/">â€œPrincess Mononokeâ€ </a>describes  extremely well some of the concepts of Kami. One can get a better understanding  from observing this film.

Kami is neither good nor evil, it has nothing to do with ethics, and it just  is what it is. It can be beneficial and also harmful. The relationship between  Kami and man depends on manâ€™s conception and behavior. However, it does not  require human attention in order to be, it exists even where there are no living  beings. It may actually be much stronger in places where man is not  prevalent.

As well as some of the veterans in AKBAN I envisage Kami as a sort of  presence or power in certain places in nature. In Israel there are many places  where you can feel it, especially in the barren relatively empty south of the  country. When arriving in a place and feeling something different, something not  sensed before, when seeing something or standing somewhere that arises certain  feelings, these are signs of Kami. Some places create a certain atmosphere or  feeling, while other places create a different feeling altogether. One must be  very sensitive since our culture, the way we live our daily lives, have numbed  our abilities to feel.

Weâ€™re not speaking of a being, but about nature that usually affect us in  gentle and subtle ways, and sometimes in bursts of power. This power is always  present, even when we do not sense it.<div class="date">06/05/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Blog">Blog</a>, <a data-tag="thinktank">thinktank</a>, <a data-tag="From the Old Newspaper">From the Old Newspaper</a>, <a data-tag="Japan">Japan</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Guy Renan">Author: Guy Renan</a></div>
