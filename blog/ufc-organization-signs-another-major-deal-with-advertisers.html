The mixed martial arts media company of the UFC <a href="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=10512"> signed another deal</a> with Anheuser-Busch, the manufacturers of Bud Light, the worldâ€™s best-selling beer.
This adds to another <a href="http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=news.detail&gid=9644"> major deal</a> with Harley Davidson. Both of these deals show the huge support and mainstream acceptance of this rising form of spectator sport.
