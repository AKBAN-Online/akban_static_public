University of Illinois PhD student Rajinder Sodhi and Disney Research’s Ivan Poupyrev published a prototype of a device that creates a standing, tactile, controllable, air-wave. 

The air pressure produced by this prototype is tactile and can be linked with Kinect, and similar devices, to function not only on a passive three dimensional virtual world but in a virtual world that has a variable and controllable tactile and physical dimensions. 

Even though we are traditional Ninjutsu practitioners, I write about <a href="http://www.akban.org/article/183/virtual-martial-arts-training-with-the-wii" title="Wii in martial arts - 2007">technological</a> and thought provoking insights that have helped not only the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Portal:_Ninjutsu" title="ninjutsu portal">documentation of our tradition</a> using a highly semantic wiki but will, in the future, assist learning, practicing and teaching using new devices that will incorporate depth, tactile information and other variables. 

As I look at it, the difference between a boxing bag or a wing chun wooden dummy and the AIREAL devices is not essential. As a training aid these just differ in technology.
