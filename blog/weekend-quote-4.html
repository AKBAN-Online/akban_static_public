Food, tasty and good, is the basis for health and good feeling, it takes time, good advice and luck until we eat right.

Books are nourishment too.

Short paragraphs, on a digital platform or in the newspaper, are like sprinting to catch the bus, necessary, but not the same as running for an hour in the mountains. Learning to read right is a bit like learning to run long distances, <b>we need a reading fitness plan</b>, we can read longer and longer sections, make it a habit.

What does this have to do with martial arts? Our teachers exemplified, 文武一道 bun bu ichido, the brush stroke and the cut, the pen and the sword, learning and fighting, are one thing. In ancient Aramaic too: Safra ve Saifa (סָפְרָא וסַיָּיפָא)- a scholar and a sword man. And they say that Rabbi Eliezer said: "The Sword And The Book Came Down Bound Together".
