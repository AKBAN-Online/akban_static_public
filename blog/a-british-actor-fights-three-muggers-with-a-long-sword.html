Here's one for the sword guys: Three unfortunate souls happened to snatch a Â£20 note from Oxford actor Tom Clews. 
Mr. Clews, who is playing Greek mythical hero Odysseus, did not hesitate, chased down the bewildered muggers stabbed one of them in the leg and detained them till the police arrived. 
 
Well done Odysseus! Mr. Clews also played Hector in The Iliad in last year's fringe and was bare chested at the event. What were those robbers thinking?

Yep, you're right, this is not madness - THIS IS OXFORD!
