We will spar today at the <a href="http://www.akban.org/courses/tel-aviv/" title="tel aviv dojo">Tel Aviv dojo</a>, from 18:00 till 20:00. 
Today's video highlights several things. The first one is that failing with some <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/Category:Nage-waza_(%E6%8A%95%E3%81%92%E6%8A%80):_throwing_techniques" title="throws">throws</a> can be worse then not doing them. The second, most important factor, is that grappling in a mixed martial art, and especially our Ninjutsu is possible only when the opponents are allowing throws and not fighting competitively. The minute the <a href="http://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/randori-sparring.php" title="randori - sparring">randori</a> looses its cooperative, jam session, atmosphere, is the minute everything becomes very dangerous. Fortunately, in this video, all partners fight, but are still sensitive to each other.
