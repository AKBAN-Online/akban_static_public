<strong>By Yossi Sheriff</strong>

Just two years ago, G. called me and asked: "Renzo Gracie is in Israel and he has a free evening".

"Well, let's hone our BJJ skills with the best".

When Renzo walked into the Tel Aviv dojo he took a step back, either the smell, the beer or the number of people took him by surprize. As some veterans in AKBAN have been to Renzo's New York place the hesitation changed to smiles.

We learned and laughed a lot and, once again, understood that the man is not only a world class fighter but a humane and happy person. What a king!

I just caught Renzo and Pat Milletich On "60 Minutes" and now it's on Youtube. Here it is (update - it's not there anymore).
