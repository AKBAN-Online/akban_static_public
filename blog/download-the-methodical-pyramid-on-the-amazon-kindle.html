For many years I have been using a systematic model to plan the intersection between a very traditional martial art and the modern warfare that shadows us here, in Israel. I wrote it about 15 years ago and posted it in Hebrew and on our English site (<a href="http://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/" title="methodical pyramid">Methodical pyramid</a> on AKBAN.org). It is still here, free for all. 

From today you can download the <b>Kindle edition</b> of the core AKBAN training plan - (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081N0IPK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=budoninjutsu-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0081N0IPK" title="kindle methodical pyramid">Methodical pyramid - Kindle edition</a>). 

Preserving the <a href="http://www.akban.org/2012/01/12/respect" title="respect">respect</a> and spiritual frame that stems from our Ninjutsu is a heritage I owe to my teacher, Doron Navon. During the 15 years I spent as his student I had many opportunities to watch him grapple with the necessary hard realities of self defense situations and at the same time maintaining a very spiritual perspective. 

I think that for the AKBAN instructors the years ahead must be a time of further exploring, both of the hard realities of self defense and warfare and the spiritual insights of our very unique disciplin.
