Looking at the outside manifestations of the angry will show you they are insane. They share the same features as a lunatic: an aggressive swagger, a twisted eyebrow, a ferocious expression, a quickness to the walking pace, fidgety hands, a changed complexion, a fast and aggressive breathing - these are the signs of the angry man; his eyes spit fire, his face is red with blood that sprouts from the sewer of his guts, his mouth trembles, his teeth are clenched, his hair bristles and stands on end, his breath is laborious, his joints squeak, his voice is uncontrolled, he speaks stupidities, claps his hands, stamps the ground; his whole body is excited and geared toward threatening and intimidating.
