These were more then 12 nerve recking hours...

Due to huge increase in user traffic on our martial arts encyclopedia and because of the big data bases demands that were tasking our previous server we had to move your martial arts site. 

We now host this huge web site on a separate server.
The good news are that it was worth it, every page loads faster, especially the <a href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page"> AKBAN-wiki</a> but also more esoteric issues like <a href="http://www.akban.org/index.php/images/headgear/"> esoteric ninja hats</a>.

Sorry, friends, we didn't think it would be that complicated. 

Oh, almost forgot, thanks to Erik R. who from far far away found the DNS problem that was the root cause and corrected it.

Thanks to all of you who sent mails regarding this problem.<div class="date">19/06/2007</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Billionsofblueblisteringbarnacles">Billionsofblueblisteringbarnacles</a>, <a data-tag="Author:ninjutsu">Author:ninjutsu</a></div>
