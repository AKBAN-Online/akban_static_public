Last month <a href="http://emotiv.com/corporate/2_0/2_1.htm"> Emotive</a> announced another device that's claiming to bridge the gap between thoughts and video game controllers.
The device reads EEG and transforms them into electrical signal to be used in a variety of systems.

This is not the first device that takes the gamer one step closer into the realm where virtual fighting can simulate reality. We reported on the <a href="http://www.akban.org/article/280/virtual-martial-arts-training----part-2"> Wii controller</a> earlier this year.
I am not too happy about these tech development as I do not think anything can take the place of the Dojo. But I also know for sure - nothing will stop technology. Is this the beginning of the end for martial arts? We have already seen flight drones replacing real pilots. Are UFC fighters the obvious next step?<div class="date">28/04/2008</div><div class="meta"><a data-tag="AKBAN Journal">AKBAN Journal</a>, <a data-tag="Culture">Culture</a>, <a data-tag="Technology">Technology</a>, <a data-tag="Author: Yossi Sheriff">Author: Yossi Sheriff</a>, <a data-tag="Author:Shimi Samuel">Author:Shimi Samuel</a></div>
