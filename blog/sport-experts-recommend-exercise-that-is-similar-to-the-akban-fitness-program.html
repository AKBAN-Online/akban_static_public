Experts from the <a href="http://www.acsm.org//AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home_Page"> American College of Sports Medicine</a> recommend an exercise routine that is almost identical to the <a href="http://www.akban.org/fitness/"> AKBAN fitness program</a>.
Just take a look at this:
THE NEW ADVICE FOR ADULTS AGED 18-65
30 minutes of moderate exercise on five days of the week
or
20 minutes of vigorous exercise on three days of the week
or
A combination of the moderate and vigorous exercise goals
AND
Two weekly sessions of activity (weight training) to maintain muscle strength

AKBAN's physicians, sport experts and physical therapists came up with the same program years ago, but what made me happy was the ages listed on the recommendation: ADULTS AGED 18-65.
