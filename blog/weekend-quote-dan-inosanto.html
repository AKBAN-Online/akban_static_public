Knowledge is constantly moving. As we speak now, the martial art changes. Every generation.

George Washington was the father of our country. He had an army. Let's follow his way, let's wear the same uniform, that George Washington wore. Use the same rifle, same ammunition, same tactics. Take them abroad? they are going to die.

Because you have to keep up. Everything changes. Everything evolves in martial art.
