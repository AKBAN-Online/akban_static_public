There is one protection against both kinds of disproportion :That we should not move the body without the soul or the soul without the body, and thus they will be on their guard against each other, and be healthy and well balanced. 
And therefore the mathematician or any one else whose thoughts are much absorbed in some intellectual pursuit, must allow his body also to have due exercise, and practice gymnastics; 
And he who is careful to fashion the body, should in turn impart to the soul its proper motions, and should cultivate music and all philosophy, if he would deserve to be called truly fair and truly good.
