<p style="text-align: justify;">A student asked me: “Can I do the warm-up with a T-shirt and only then put a Gi on? It’s too hot inside this heavy uniform”. “That’s only logical” I thought, “only logical”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We wear a Hakama, a little black skirt, and also a heavy Gi, we put our big backpacks and walk the desert for the <a title="Why do we train outside" href="http://www.akban.org/about/why-outside.php" target="_blank">desert gathering</a>, we do not use GPS. It’s just a taste of the many unexplainable things we do. There is more to these then tradition or toughness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I acknowledge the fact, many of these habits are unnecessary and can be made easier, but there is a place for it, it has to do with the concept of <a title="respect" href="http://www.akban.org/2012/01/12/respect" target="_blank">respect</a>. Work, respect, must always border the unnecessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I recounted the dialog above in the Dojo, one veteran told me: “In the Suez canal, in the Yom Kippur war, we knew it’s the end - either we’ll die or we'll get captured by the Egyptian army. We felt like it’s the end of the world. We didn’t know if we’ll live to see tomorrow".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I looked at him; I didn’t know what to say in front of the veterans. I’m kind of an ancient guy, but in the Yom Kippur war I was a kid in elementary school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And then what did you do?” I finally inquired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We cleaned our weapons, we checked the platoon’s machine guns, and then we tidied our uniforms and meticulously shined our shoes”. I took a good look at him - he never misses a class and in the Yom Kippur war he polished his shoes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In our culture the question asked is: “What’s in it for me?” that’s a different way of saying: “why should I do it?”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any old school, the question is completely different. Rather then ask about the the functions of the anatomy we sing to the heart. When one answers a question about roses with a mathematical equation one is stuck, there is no perfume in the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a practice, a Budo, is completely logical and necessary it’s good but not powerful. To be powerful is another realm, to be powerful it has to earn the statue of a rose. It must not be fully explainable. Treating our elders well, not stealing even when no one’s looking, putting on a Hakama and a Gi especially on a hot day and, please do not forget - practicing a traditional Martial art in the modern battle field of the middle east.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budo, with it’s health benefits, with the level of security it allows its practitioners, gets its power from somewhere else. Practicing for many years is the essence of the unnecessary, and so is the seed of personal freedom, the freedom to work hard. Zorba the greek summed it up: “This is true happiness: to have no ambition and to work like a horse as if you had every ambition.”</p>
