How to determine the size of a tree? According to its height? The diameter of its trunk? Scope of its crown? None of these is an absolute criterion, but when you see a large tree, you know what it's like, and you hear: the wind's noise is different and more pleasant than the sound it makes with the branches of its little brothers. And also feel, all the plants emit oxygen, freshness, various aromas. But the great trees also emit calm and confidence and a hard to contain pleasant surprise.
