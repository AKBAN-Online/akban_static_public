<b>The AKBAN kamon, or crest, consists of two phoenixes</b>, balancing each other while forming a heart shape with their beaks. 

The phoenix, a myth that simbolizes disappearing in fire and resurrection of essence, is a fitting example for the AKBAN endeavor: to explore and preserve ancient martial arts while fearlessly researching methods and weapons anew.
