AKBAN is a Martial arts research institute that was founded in Israel and has dojos in Israel, Germany, Canada, Greece and soon, in Japan. Yossi Sheriff is the AKBAN Academy headmaster. Our veterans have decades of experience.

Extreme training regime is augmented by the conflict managment tools and unique power control techniques of <a href="https://www.detant.org/eng">DETANT</a>.

We train the way we like by absorbing ourselves in Japanese <a title="Ninjutsu techniques" href="https://www.akban.org/wiki/Portal:_Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu techniques</a> while fearlessly <a title="research in akban" href="https://www.akban.org/about/research.php">researching</a>. We don't care about politics, political values, belt systems or Mc-dojos – what matters to us is dojo time, heart and <a title="Practicing outdoors" href="https://www.akban.org/about/why-outside.php">earth</a>, that's it: One principle - <strong>There are No shortcuts, but there is Kwisatz Haderach</strong>.

This site is our dedication to what we love: the warrior culture, and all this is free, our <a title="respect" href="https://www.akban.org/2012/01/12/respect">respect</a> to you.

The Academy's headquarters is situated in <a title="Tel Aviv" href="https://www.akban.org/courses/tel-aviv/">Tel Aviv</a>, and another office is in <a title="Jerusalem" href="https://www.akban.org/courses/jerusalem/">Jerusalem</a>. We have graduate instructors all over Israel, working in small, sparring oriented, dojos. Our recent dojo addition is in Toronto, Canada.

It is not easy to say what makes the Akban community so robust; is it the Israeli situation, the top notch <a href="https://www.akban.org/fitness/">fitness</a>? Who knows? We believe part of it is the special kind of students who choose training with us, students that get involved in <a href="https://www.akban.org/about/24-hours-akban-training.php">incredible achievements</a> and continue training for a lifetime. As we said, we are not sure, but we love the atmosphere, you can catch the scent of it in many of the images in our galleries or come train with us. Tel Aviv is a fun city.

There are never guarantees that we’ll make a warrior from every new student, the only guarantee is that whatever we do, we do it with our extensive <a title="method for combat preparation" href="https://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/">knowledge</a>, our heart, taking no shortcuts, the way we see it.
