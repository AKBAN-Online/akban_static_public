"AKBAN Detant LTD. specializes in teaching emotional regulation, mindfulness, and resilience through targeted physical micro-procedures.
<br><br>

Confrontational stress can obstruct procedural memory, resulting in hormonal, neural, and cognitive responses that limit our perspective, impair judgment, affect fine motor skills, and escalate conflicts. It's crucial to remain fully in control, even in challenging moments.
<br><br>
Detant's emotional regulation techniques provide a toolbox for navigating stressful situations effectively. Through physical procedures, we cultivate combat mindfulness and lifelong discipline. Detant's control techniques stem from AKBAN CORE and are rooted in scientific research. We explore the interplay between body, emotion, and cognition.
<br><br>
Our workshops have become essential for preparing medical ER teams, HAZMAT operators, and elite IDF unit commanders. Discover how to control fear, anger, and stress by participating in Detant's groundbreaking workshops. Learn to remain calm, resolute, and focused in stressful situations and daily routines.
