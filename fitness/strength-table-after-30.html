<h3>The physical preparation after the age of 30</h3> 


<p><b>Get checked by an M.D.</b> - When you begin training or resume training after more than a year of, you must undergo a physical examination by a medical doctor, passing a medical check is necessary, since the effort level is very high. We recommend that you undergo not only an EKG test, but also cardiac functions and blood pressure stress testing.</p>

<p>Do get checked frequently, especially if members of your family have cardiac illness of any kind, if you are overweight, if you smoke or if you do not engage in regular physical activity. You must undergo an ergometric test (which is done on a treadmill) and consult with a cardiologist before and during training.</p> 

<p>This table should be used only under a certified instructor. Don't do this table on your own. If you don't understand, please ask your instructors here or an experienced instructor that you work with. We are here to help, if possible.</p>

<h4>How many repetitions?</h4>

<p>In order to start the training table, check how much you are doing usually. And not your maximum, be conservative, do not rush. If you have been doing one push up a month then do not start with ten push-ups on the table, start with one.

If you haven't practiced strength exercises for more then a month, just start at the beginning. Your aim should be gradual and maintainable practice rather than a short explosive career.</p>

<p>Strength training is not an option, it's a necessity, and therefore you have to start gradually in order not to burden your body and soul. Literally, hundreds of our practitioners have checked these tables for more then fifteen years.</p>

<p>Push-ups are a much hated exercise because they stress not only the arm

and chest muscles, but also the straight and diagonal abdominal muscles. The

intra-abdominal pressure goes up considerably during this exercise, which

necessitates contraction of the sphincters in the floor of the pelvis. In a

similar exercise in a gym, the practitioners lie on their back and are given

a bar to be pushed up. The gym exercise is easier (naturally depending on the

weight), because the internal abdominal muscles and sphincters are not under

as much stress. For this reason we prefer regular push-ups and, later in

advanced levels, regular push-ups with a weight on the back.</p>

<h4>Sit ups</h4> 

<p>When doing sit-ups, do at least a third of them diagonally, reaching with

your hand towards the opposite knee.</p>

<p class="point-to-note">Always do pull-ups in three or four sets. This is

the only exercise that will improve only if you repeat the number of chin ups again in the same session.</p>

<p class="point-to-note">If you cannot do even a single pull-up, begin by

holding on to the bar with both hands. Using your hands, hang from the bar for 2-3

seconds. In two weeks you can be hanging from the bar for about 20 seconds.

Next, try to achieve at least one pull-up while twisting your body to assist

the hands.</p> 



<p class="point-to-note">Pull-ups is an exercise that depends on regular

training. If you perform it almost every day, your progress will be fine.</p> 

<p class="point-to-note">Store-bought horizontal bars which have been

installed at home have already caused some unpleasant injuries because of

incorrect installation. If you use one of those, be sure to straighten your

legs while pulling, that way, in case you fall, you will not injure your

kneecaps.</p>

<h3>Priorities of the strength exercise - From the most important exercises to the less important</h3>

        <p>These requirements are AKBAN's minimum standard, but you will find that in some cases there is neither time nor energy to perform even the necessary minimum. Thus, assuming you have reached a reasonable level of training, this is the recommended priority, from the most important exercise to the also important, but not as much. If you have time for only one exercise do pull ups, if you have time for two exercises do pull ups and sit-ups, etc.</p>

<p><b>Running</b> - at the very minimum run twice a week - according to our tables</p>
