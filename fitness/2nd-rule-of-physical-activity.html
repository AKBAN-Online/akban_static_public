<h2>The 2nd rule of physical training - AKBAN</h2>
<p></p>

<h3>"Practice should be gradual and regular "</h3>

<p>This rule is valid for all types of training in which we are involved:
cardio-vascular, strength and flexibility. This rule also applies to
technical martial movement training.</p>

<p>No shortcuts: Each phase is thorough and slow. Skipping steps or hurrying
progression can, in many cases, result in injury, whether self-inflicted or
by another student. We have seen it and experienced injuries for many times,
which guided us to tweak our fitness program. The program is now mature and
enables new students to enjoy a steady and healthy advance in all their
physical abilities.</p>

<p>After reaching the desired level of ability, we must maintain it by
training at least 3 times a week. Less than that can lead the body to atrophy
and to lose prior achievements.</p>

<p>If you consistently practice in a group and regularly spar, you can
substitute certain workouts.</p>

<p>However, there will always be legitimate reasons for not attending class
(such as traveling, family obligations etc) and one should not be dependant
on the group for physical activity. Training less frequently in a group
requires supplemental training in order to maintain a steady and regular
habit as well as keeping the body at a proper level of fitness and energy.
The Independent Kernel Training program is that supplemental activity.</p>

<p>The "independent training kernel" can substitute for group training only
for a while; its main goal is to maintain a steady and constant level of
physical and technical practice. Maintenance and improvement of
cardiovascular ability, flexibility and power workout are an important part
of independent training kernel;</p>
