<b>Get checked by an M.D.</b> - When you begin training or resume training after more than a year of hiatus, you must undergo a physical examination by a medical doctor. Passing a medical check is necessary, since the effort level may be very high. We recommend that you undergo not only an EKG test, but also cardiac functions and blood pressure stress testing.</p>

<p>If you are overweight or smoke and do not engage in regular physical activity. You must undergo an ergometric test (which is done on a treadmill) and consult with a cardiologist before and during training.</p>

<p>Please get a physical, dying while training is such a bummer.</p>

<p><b>Read the program</b> - After getting a physical check and the approval of your doctor, read the reasons for our uniquely slow fitness program, learn why we prefer running outside, why we use free weights or non at all and what to do if you have orthopedic pain.</p>

<p><b>Get shoes</b> - Buy suitable running shoes (we recommend New Balance or Mizuno, which are easily available in Israel , for starters).</p>

<p><b>Make time</b> - regular time is the <b>keystone</b>: A time during which you will be able to run regularly. Many veterans' favorite time is either early in the morning, before you have to concentrate on your duties to your family or after you finish work.</p>

<p><b>Frequent and easy training</b> - Do not train less than two times a week. This is the absolute minimum. If you only run once a week, you will be better off not running at all! Plan your schedule so you can run at least three times a week. This way, the body will receive a consistent message: something good is happening to it.</p>

<p><b>Get the help of people around you</b> - you can train more easily with their support; explain to the people who are important to you that you are going to begin running and strength training. Let them know the importance of running and ask them to help you keep up your commitment to training.</p>

<p><b>Follow the relevant tables to the letter!</b> These tables are age specific; choose the table according to your actual age. The only change you can make is going even slower, repeating the same week twice or more. Only work according to the beginners' running and strength Tables. Do not skip phases, do not add to it, and do not simultaneously begin training in a sport involving your legs (ski, dancing, etc.) until your legs grow stronger. Only then will you be able to indulge yourself in several kinds of sports. You need to go easy during the first year so you will be able to keep training for life.</p>

<p>Within the Budo Ninjutsu group, <b>ask your instructor</b>. In any event of pain of an orthopedic nature, go to an orthopedist or a sports physician. Stop running until the pain is over.</p>

<p>You can begin when you are ready. Now is always a good time.</p>
