<span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency situations happen unexpectedly and have a quality to them that causes less then ideal reactions. Even well rehearsed standard operating procedures are sometimes forgotten in the heat of crisis.  Fear, stress and anger are the culprits. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In extreme, dire, events, correct situation assessment, precise decision making and fast action are imperative. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Detant teaches a set of tools that uses a body first approach in order to calm the mind. When one controls physical reactions to stress and fear one overcomes and control his mental and emotional states as well. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our techniques are simple and have been proven many times in the demanding Israeli scenario. As a result of the drilling in our workshops, physical habits are embedded that get activated in the event of a  crisis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using our tools will enable personnel to act effectively and cope with emergency situations professionally.</span>
