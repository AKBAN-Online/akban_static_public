<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers, soldiers and security personnel at any level are facing daily dilemmas regarding their duties. On the one hand they must stay sharp, focused and ready to encounter life threatening incidents, on the other hand they are dealing many times with situations that are best dealt with using minimal force and empathy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Especially now, in the social media age, when everyone carries high quality camera at hand, a suitable, proper solution to complex situations is a prerequisite for any organisation. The implications of an incident that goes out of control are grave and hurt both the personnel and the organisation.  </span></p>
