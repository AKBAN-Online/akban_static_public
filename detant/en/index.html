The DETANT workshops create a safe learning environment that teaches emotional regulation and power in stressful times. These practices and insights are the result of our experience in two diametrical fields - the insights gained from teaching martial arts in <a href="http://www.akban.org">AKBAN</a> and the Israeli security situation.

The procedures in our workshops give an exact set of tools. Using these techniques, the cognitive, the emotional and the physical cross-influence, but it is mainly through the physical - and that means done in body - practices that we can set a measured reaction, stay focused and maintain control in emotionally chaotic times.
