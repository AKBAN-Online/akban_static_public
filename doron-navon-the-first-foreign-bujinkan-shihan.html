<p>Doron Navon holds the distinction of being the first non-Japanese Bujinkan Shihan and the inaugural foreigner to pass the Godan test under the tutelage of Hatsumi Masaki.</p>
<p>
Beginning his martial arts journey in Israel under Gadi Skornik, Doron Navon trained in Judo, eventually rising to join the Olympic team. An unfortunate tournament injury spared him from the Munich Olympic games. Navon was among the early Israeli professionals to study Krav Maga with Imi Lichtenfeld, and later with Eli Avigazar, a prominent figure in bringing <a title="Krav maga in the AKBAN wiki" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Krav_Maga">Krav maga</a> to the United States.</p>
<p>
Venturing to Japan, Navon studied Judo at the Kodokan and later achieved his 4th degree Judo black belt under his Kodokan instructor. During his time in Japan, he began learning <a title="Ninjutsu in the AKBAN wiki" href="http://www.akban.org/wiki/index.php/Ninjutsu">Ninjutsu</a> from Hatsumi Masaaki, the headmaster of the Bujinkan school. Following years of dedicated learning, he was granted the Shihan (highest ability) grade and the certification to establish a Dojo in Israel.

In 1976, Navon opened the first foreign Ninjutsu dojo outside Japan in a rural area near Tel Aviv. Alongside rigorous meditation and martial arts training, Navon was the pioneer martial arts teacher to complete the Feldenkrais instructor's course while integrating crucial insights from Yoga and Judo. He developed a personal friendship with Moshe Feldenkrais.</p>

Seven AKBAN black belts, including Yossi Sheriff, the current headmaster of AKBAN, were privately mentored by Doron Navon Shihan and passed their tests under his guidance at the AKBAN Jerusalem dojo.

Navon has since retired from martial arts instruction and currently continues his practice and research in meditation and movement in Japan.</p>
