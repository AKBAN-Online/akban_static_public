AKBAN is a Martial arts research institute that was founded in Israel and has dojos in Israel, Germany, Canada, Greece and soon, in Japan. <a class="external text" href="https://www.akban.org/about/sheriff.php">Yossi Sheriff</a> is the Akban academy headmaster and a <a title="Godan" href="https://www.akban.org/2011/12/29/my-test-for-5th-dan">Bujinkan 5th Dan</a> (1991). The academy was founded by Sheriff in 1986. Our veterans have decades of experience.

Extreme training regime is augmented by the conflict managment tools and unique power control techniques of DETANT (<a href="https://detant.org">דטאנט</a>). The Akban control system, Detant,&nbsp;teaches emotional and cognitive regulation.

We train the way we like by absorbing ourselves in Japanese Ninjutsu techniques while fearlessly researching. We don’t care about politics, political values, belt systems or Mc-dojos – what matters to us is dojo time, heart and earth, that’s it: One principle – No shortcuts.
AKBAN teaches combat oriented, pragmatic, Bujinkan Ninjutsu as a way of life since 1985. This site is the largest existing&nbsp;<a title="AKBAN wiki" href="https://www.akban.org/wiki/Main_Page">encyclopaedia</a> of combat Ninjutsu techniques and conflict methodology.

Our way of training enables:
<ol>
 	<li>Superb fitness - gradual program written by Yossi Sheriff</li>
 	<li>Many years of full contact realistic training. Hundreds of practitioners have been training for more then 30 consecutive years.</li>
 	<li>Combat martial abilities.</li>
</ol>
Founding the iron clad discipline and <a title="fitness" href="https://www.akban.org/fitness/">fitness</a> are our most valuable assets - <a title="respect" href="https://www.akban.org/2012/01/12/respect">respect</a> for our students and our ancient heritage.
<h4>Using the name AKBAN</h4>
Our school does not work like a fast food franchise, it works like Universities do.
Every instructor enjoys full independence while teaching the techniques that lead to a Black belt. This independence comes with full responsibility of each instructor over his own dojo. Thus, each instructor can bring into fruition a personal perspective and abilities and contribute his knowledge to the technical data base that forms the AKBAN database.
Choosing whether to give the name AKBAN is a personal creed of the head of each dojo who is also a student in central dojo under Yossi Sheriff.
The instructor leads his dojo, but chooses to continue and develop as a part of a community that follows the ethical code of AKBAN.

About ten instructors teach in Dojos in Israel, Greece, Germany and Canada.

We base our Martial arts knowledge and practice on the <a class="external text" href="https://www.akban.org/pyramid_en/">methodical pyramid model</a>. Good friendship and all-round expertise created the <a class="external text" href="https://www.akban.org/wiki/">Akban-wiki</a>.

The Akban mon is two phoenix birds intertwined. The phoenixes, creatures that disappear in fire and return every thousand years, symbolize the preservation and practice of ancient knowledge. Budo Ninjutsu is a martial art that originated hundreds of years ago. We guard it's essence with constant practice and research.

The two phoenixes depict the power and harmony that stem from communion of opposites: Man and environment, tradition and research, extreme activity and meditation, opponents and defenders.

Along the communion of opposites, the beaks of the creature create the shape of a heart to remind us the most important reason of the martial art we are doing - guarding our humane hearts, guarding the people dear to us, guarding peace.
