The "AKBAN 24" was an extreme sparring event that went on until we couldn't physically repeat it. We managed to complete only four "24". Weather conditions stopped two other events after about 14 and 15 hours.<br>
<br>

The "AKBAN 24" started at 16:00, continued through the night, with no sleep or rest, and concluded at next day's sunset, at 16:00. Only five minutes recess were allowed every hour and these are devoted to drinking, stretching replenishing calories and injury treatment. After these five minutes we changed partners and continued sparring (striking, kicking, throws and ground-work) for another hour.<br>
<br>
At the "A24" 2003 event we applied to the Guinness book of records, including notary witnesses, non-stop video of the event and the proper waivers and medical personnel needed for an extreme event. Because of a rare October heat wave, we were stopped by the resident M.D. required by the Guinness book of records, after several veterans collapsed and needed hospitalization we gave up on that specific A24 that year after 15 hours of sparring. <br>

The AKBAN <a title="fitness" href="http://www.akban.org/fitness/">fitness routine</a> is the foundation of the fitness we needed at these events. We continue to spar, run Marathons and <a title="Advanced running table" href="http://www.akban.org/fitness/phase-2-advanced-running-table-age-under-35.php">Ultras</a>, but the "24" is the toughest, most difficult thing we have done.
