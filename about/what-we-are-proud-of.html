<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>Values lead the way, with professionalism trailing behind, echoing our mantra: "Be a human being first, and only when necessary, a warrior."</li>
<li>Training, an endless cycle of repetition, unfolds week after week, year after year, decade after decade. "Training is not a choice," we proclaim. Since 1976, we have devoted ourselves to its rigorous pursuit.</li>
	<li>Testing and scrutiny occupy our weeks as we subject each technique to the crucible of combat conditions. We question their efficacy and the intricacies of execution</li>
<li>Proficiency in communication begets professionalism. Only through a community of seasoned practitioners, capable of sharing wisdom and mutually assessing skills, can we embrace diverse disciplines of combat.</li>
<li>Learning is our lifeblood. AKBAN's venerable practitioners engage in lessons beyond our walls, immersing themselves in various martial arts. Such adherence to tradition aligns with AKBAN Ninjutsu's ethos. The knowledge acquired reverberates within our community and reaches others through the AKBAN-wiki, a beacon for veterans seeking perspectives. We welcome teachers of other martial arts to impart fresh perspectives and novel combat ideologies. Akin to the tradition's ancestral roots, AKBAN Ninjutsu encompasses not just a handful of techniques, but a tapestry of nine distinct systems.</li>
<li>Safety, a long-held revelation, underscores our ethos. The price of training on the precipice of readiness is not cheap; injuries often befall us long before an imagined battlefield emerges. Thus, safety remains paramount in our pursuit of dojo longevity.</li>
<li>Preparation bolsters our safety net. We employ a balanced and sensible fitness program, attaining extraordinary levels of physical prowess. AKBAN Ninjutsu's demanding nature mandates full-contact combat in every lesson, heightening the risk of falls and forceful encounters. Gradually, we work our bodies, acclimating them to the demands of our craft. Unnecessary aggression yields to measured engagement forces. Within the realm of training combats, maturity and physical conditioning stand as our steadfast guardians.</li></ul>
		<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our safety is also in preparation, we use the one of the most moderate and sensible <a href="http://www.akban.org/fitness/">fitness programs</a> to bring our practitioners to extreme fitness levels. AKBAN Ninjutsu is a tough martial art, in which full contact combats are preformed every lesson. There's an extreme risk of injury due to falls and contact. We gradually prepare our bodies in order to accustom ourselves to the efforts. We avoid unnecessary aggression in training combats. Maturity and physical conditioning are our safety net.</p>
