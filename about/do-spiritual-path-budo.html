<p style="text-align: justify;">Budō is a practical and spiritual path based on active participation of body, mind and heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its aim is to make the practitioner a better human being. The goal might be far but the path's boundaries are clear: A better human being is one who can balance his body, mind and heart with his and others. A martial arts practitioner has a speciality and a destiny: to create an inner harmony of these even in the midst of strife.</p>
